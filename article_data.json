        "content": "As the summer holiday season has ended, we take the opportunity to look back at the first half of 2023 in the world of EU/EEA social security. See our alert here which covers our initial look into 2023 published at the start of the year.\n\nIt has been a hectic year. From a European perspective, some of the most consequential developments for the past 10+ years have taken place.\n\nIn the aftermath of Covid-19, cross-border commuting and working from home has become a new normal. Current EU/EEA rules trigger social security obligations for employers in the country of residence where an employee works 25% or more in that country.\n\nIntensive work has been completed to install a solution which could easily and quickly solve this issue, and lead to the introduction of the Framework agreement. This gave countries the possibility to opt for a solution which raises the 25% threshold to 50% in certain situations.\n\n> Please find further information about this here.\n\nNot all countries opted for this framework agreement, meaning the existing rules (25% threshold) will remain applicable, with the teleworker relaxation ending no later than 30 June 2022.\n\n> Please find further information about this here.\n\nThe above-mentioned Framework Agreement only provides a temporary solution to challenges arising from the new WFH arrangement. The scope of the agreement is narrow, for example only allowing limited business travel in other EU/EEA countries.\n\nFor any cases that fall outside of the scope of the agreement, the traditional rules of EU/EEA social security coordination continue to apply, and some of the solutions for managing WFH scenarios can be found below:\n\nPlease find our global alerts described here. We reiterate that the application of these rules vary across the EU/EEA and should be considered on a case by case basis.\n\nA proposal for amending the EU/EEA guidelines has been pending since 2016. This includes amendments to the obligation to apply for A1 for business travellers. No substantial progression has been made in the matter for the first half of 2023.\n\nThe CJEU has new judgement in cases regarding social security\n\nThe European Commission has now taken further steps to progress the digitalization of the A1 with 12 countries included in the pilot case (running since 2021), with the end goal of fully automating A1 processes from filing until delivery to host country authorities.\n\nHow can we help\n\nCurrently, we are assisting companies in:\n\n\n\nContact us\n\nPlease feel free to reach out your local social security contact at Vialto Partners or to the Vialto Partners Social Security Leadership team:",

        "date": "December 10, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nRecently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security issued the latest notice (Renshebufa [2024] No. 75) announcing that from 1 December 2024, the integration of foreign work permits with social security card will be implemented. This new arrangement will involve including the information from foreign work permit on the social security card, thereby enhancing administrative efficiency and offering more convenience and benefits. Also, it will no doubt serve as an integrated platform for local departments to monitor and assess the compliance status of foreign nationals participating in China’s social security scheme.\n\nThe detail\n\nUnder the new system, foreign nationals will no longer be issued a physical Work Permit Card. Instead, their work permit information will be digitized and displaced on the electronic Social Security system, which can be accessed through a mobile application.\n\nDifferent situations require different approaches to effectively navigate through the new change:\n\nIn the future, foreign nationals will have access to their Work Permit information through the new Social Security system. Individuals can download the “eSSCard” app on their mobile phones.\n\nIn accordance with the current China Social Security Law (effective from July 1, 2011) and the Interim Measures for Foreign Nationals Participating in China Social Security Scheme (effective from 15 October 2011), all local Chinese companies and their foreign employees must register and contribute to social security system, covering pension, medical, work injury, unemployment, and maternity insurance. Failure to make full and timely contributions may result in late payment surcharges or penalties. This requirement applies to all foreign employees, whether they are locally hired foreign or under a “secondment” arrangement.\n\nHowever, enforcement and local practice differ from city to city. Taking Shanghai as an example, under the previous local policy “Shanghai [2009] No. 38” (valid until 15 August 2021), it was commonly understood that foreign employees working in Shanghai had some flexibility in participating in the Chinese social security system. They could opt to contribute to pension, medical and work injury insurance, and agree the contribution arrangement with their employers.\n\nUpon the expiration of the above local policy and the integration of foreign work permits and China social security cards, it is expected that local authorities will implement more rigorous regulatory scrutiny and stricter practice requirements. Consequently, we highly recommend the following key action points for companies and foreign employees:\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nJacky Chu\nChina Lead Partner\n\nSheree Cang\nChina Immigration Partner\n\nGertie Chen\nChina Tax Partner\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "October 11, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nUAE | Visa on Arrival Update\n\nSummary\n\nThe UAE Government has recently amended the length of stay granted to specific nationalities eligible for a Visa on Arrival. Consequently, nationals from these countries can now travel to the UAE for 90 days within a 180 day period, for business and tourism purposes.\n\nThe detail\n\nWith immediate effect, the following countries are now eligible to enter the UAE on Visa on Arrival to the UAE s for a stay of up to 90 days. This is an amendment from the previous position, which granted these nationalities a stay of 30 days on entry to the UAE:\n\nAustralia\n\nBrazil – Brazilian passport holders were previously granted a duration of stay of 90 days within a 12 month period\n\nCanada\n\nChina\n\nJapan\n\nSingapore\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUnited States\n\nFollowing this change, nationals of the above countries will now be granted a multiple-entry Visit Visa upon arrival at any port of entry within the UAE, provided the individual holds a passport that is valid for more than six months, with at least two blank visa pages. The multiple-entry Visit Visa will be valid for a total of 180 days from the date of entry for a total stay of up to 90 days.\n\nWhat this means\n\nIndividuals can stay for up to 90 days during a 180 day period from date of first entry into the UAE, without having to leave the UAE every 30 days (as previously required for the above nationalities). This flexibility is especially beneficial for business travellers who may otherwise need to manage multiple visits to the country.\n\nEmployers will need to ensure that their business travellers are only conducting permissible business activities during any frequent trips or extended trips to the UAE. Individuals and employers will also need to keep track of the amount of time spent in the UAE over a 180 day period, so that it does not exceed 90 days. The 90 day ‘clock’ will restart once the 180 day period has been completed.\n\nOverall, the extension of Visa on Arrival periods for these specific nationalities demonstrates the Government’s commitment to establish the UAE as a prominent global destination for business and leisure, and to also diversify the economy, in accordance with Tourism Strategy 2030.\n\nHow we can help\n\nAt Vialto Partners we possess the necessary expertise to help you navigate the ever-changing Immigration landscape within the UAE and we can support you with understanding how these changes could impact your business. We can advise you as to the visitor and business visa requirements, conduct assessments and ensure overall Immigration compliance.\n\nWe will continue to closely monitor and provide timely guidance on updates and changes announced by the UAE Government.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnir Chatterji\nEMEA Immigration Partner\n\nRekha Simpson\nDirector, Middle East Immigration\n\nUmme Salma\nSenior Manager, Middle East Immigration\n\nNasrine Abdi\nManager, Middle East Immigration\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "United States | Immigration | Untimely filed extensions of stay and change of status requests",
        "date": "January 29, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nUnited States | Untimely filed extensions of stay and change of status requests\n\nSummary\nUnder current policy, nonimmigrants present in the United States, such as those in H-1B status, must file a request for an extension or change of status before the expiration date of their current status. Generally, USCIS does not approve an extension or change of status if it is filed after the expiration. USCIS does have the discretion to approve a change or extension of status in limited circumstances. With this announcement, USCIS clarifies the criteria to excuse the late filing of a petition in the event of a government shutdown.\n\nThe detail\nIn its discretion, USCIS may excuse the failure to timely file an extension of stay or change of status request if the delay was due to extraordinary circumstances. These circumstances include (1) the delay was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the applicant or petitioner, and the Service finds the delay commensurate with the circumstances; (2) the foreign national has not otherwise violated his or her nonimmigrant status; (3) the foreign national remains a bona fide nonimmigrant; and (4) the foreign national is not subject to deportation or removal proceedings.\n\nUSCIS has now clarified that these circumstances “may include but are not limited to: where the delay was due to a slowdown or stoppage of work involving a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute; or where the primary reason for the late filing is due to a lapse in government funding supporting those adjudications.” (emphasis added).\n\nPotential government shutdowns occur with some frequency, with the last two nearly occurring in January 2024 and October 2023. The most recent shutdown was in 2018.\n\nWhat this means\nIf there is a government shutdown that affects a foreign national employee’s timely filing of an extension of stay or change of status request, USCIS clarifies that the failure to timely file may qualify as an extraordinary circumstance and use its discretion to issue an approval. For example, if an employer is looking to file an H-1B extension of stay, assuming a government shutdown occurred, the late filing may be excused if the employer is unable to have the Labor Condition Application (LCA) certified by the Department of Labor.  All H-1B petitions must include a certified LCA, which the DOL cannot process during a shutdown.\n\nThis is a welcome clarification of USCIS policy that acknowledges the disruption that government shutdowns, actual or potential, can have on an employer’s business and a foreign national employee’s status and employment authorization.\n\nContact us\nPlease reach out to :\nManish Daftari\nPartner\nto discuss further:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

In the plenary session of the National Parliament dated 30 March 2023, further access facilitations regarding the Red-White-Red Card were adopted.\n\nIn accordance with the amendment to the Employment of Foreigners Act already passed by the National Parliament on 30 March 2023, language skills in French, Spanish, Bosnian, Croatian or Serbian at B1 level shall also be considered with five points in the points catalogue for the Red-White-Red Card for very highly qualified persons, other key workers, skilled workers in shortage occupations and start-up founders. A generally recognised language diploma must be presented.\n\nA skilled worker in a shortage occupation can therefore in practice be credited up to 25 points for various language skills, such as German skills at A2 level, English and Serbian skills each at B1 level; in that case, the applicant then only has to prove completed vocational training in the shortage occupation to reach the required minimum number of points of 55.\n\nThere are further simplifications for applicants of a Red-White-Red Card for regular seasonal workers: in future, they will only have to prove German language skills at A1 level instead of A2 level.\n\nThe amendment to the Employment of Foreigners Act also provides for a change for Ukrainians who have a permit for displaced persons, who shall be exempted from applying for a work permit and will in future gain unrestricted access to the Austrian labour market.\n\nThe resolution of the National Parliament is expected to pass the second parliamentary chamber on 14 April 2023, hence, the amendments are ultimately expected to enter into effect by mid-April.\n\nHow we can help\n\nContact us\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the employment of foreign nationals, the right of settlement and residence or any labour law issues related to the employment or secondment of third-country nationals or EU citizens, please do not hesitate to contact our experts:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\n* Please note that Arnez Rechtsanwalts GmbH is cooperating with the Vialto Partners network and is a member to the Vienna Bar Association, registered as an independent legal entity under Commercial register No. FN 596972a.\n\nGerman version\n\nZuletzt wurde das Ausländerbeschäftigungsgesetz (im Folgenden „AuslBG“) gemeinsam mit dem Niederlassungs- und Aufenthaltsgesetz im Herbst letzten Jahres (BGBl.

In der Plenarsitzung des Nationalrats vom 30.03.2023 wurden nun weitere Erleichterungen zum Zugang zur Rot-Weiß-Rot Karte beschlossen.\n\nEntsprechend der mit 30.03.2023 vom Nationalrat bereits verabschiedeten Novellierung des AuslBG sollen bei der Rot-Weiß-Rot Karte für besonders Hochqualifizierte, sonstige Schlüsselkräfte, Fachkräfte in Mangelberufen und Start-up-GründerInnen künftig auch Sprachkenntnisse in Französisch, Spanisch, Bosnisch, Kroatisch oder Serbisch auf B1 Niveau im Punktekatalog mit fünf Punkten Berücksichtigung finden. Auch diese müssen durch Vorlage eines allgemein anerkannten Sprachdiploms nachgewiesen werden.\n\nIn der Praxis bedeutet dies, dass beispielsweise bei einer Fachkraft im Mangelberuf bis zu 25 Punkte für diverse Sprachkenntnisse angerechnet werden können, sodass ein/e Antragssteller/In mit Deutschkenntnissen auf A2 Niveau sowie Englisch- und Serbischkenntnissen jeweils auf B1 Niveau, nur noch eine abgeschlossene Berufsausbildung im Mangelberuf nachweisen muss, um die erforderliche Mindestpunkteanzahl von 55 zu erreichen.\n\nAuch für Antragsteller einer Rot-Weiß-Rot Karte für Stammmitarbeiter gibt es Erleichterungen: Diese sollen künftig nur noch Deutschkenntnisse auf A1 Niveau, statt wie bisher auf A2 Niveau, nachweisen müssen.\n\nDie Novellierung des AuslBG sieht außerdem vor, dass UkrainerInnen, welche über einen Ausweis für Vertriebene verfügen, in Zukunft vom AuslBG ausgenommen werden und uneingeschränkten Zugang zum österreichischen Arbeitsmarkt erhalten.\n\nDer Beschluss des Nationalrats ist für die nächste Bundesratssitzung am 14.04.2023 angekündigt, sodass die Novelle voraussichtlich Mitte April in Kraft treten wird.\n\nWie können wir Sie unterstützen\n\nKontaktieren Sie uns\n\nBei Fragen im Ausländerbeschäftigungs-, dem Niederlassungs- und Aufenthaltsrecht sowie in Bezug auf arbeitsrechtliche Themen bei der Anstellung oder Entsendung von Drittstaatsangehörigen oder EU-Bürgern kontaktieren Sie gerne unsere Expertinnen:\n\nWeitere Informationen über Vialto Partners finden Sie unter: www.vialtopartners.com\n\n*Arnez Rechtsanwalts GmbH kooperiert mit dem Vialto Partners Netzwerk und ist eine bei der Rechtsanwaltskammer Wien eingetragene unabhängige Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft, welche im Firmenbuch des Handelsgerichts Wiens unter FN 596972a registriert ist.\n\nThis publication has been prepared for general guidance on matters of interest only, and does not constitute professional advice.

        "title": "United States | DHS announces new noncitizen registration requirement",
        "date": "March 6, 2025",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nThe United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced plans to implement a new registration requirement for all noncitizens to facilitate compliance with the “Protecting the American People Against Invasion” Executive Order issued by President Trump. The implementation of this requirement will lay the groundwork for the federal government to enforce civil and criminal penalties against noncitizens who fail to register, or fail to carry proof of their registration.\n\nThe detail\n\nPresident Trump issued the “Protecting the American People Against Invasion” Executive Order on January 20, 2025, which includes a directive that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) enforce a longstanding registration requirement set forth under Section 262 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 USC § 1302). Specifically, pursuant to the INA, any noncitizen 14 years or older who has not already been “registered and fingerprinted” must register with the federal government within 30 days of their arrival; noncitizens under 14 years of age must be registered by a parent. The INA provides that anyone who has not complied with this requirement may be subject to civil and criminal enforcement, including misdemeanor prosecution, imprisonment, and monetary fines.\n\nOn February 25, 2025, a USCIS announcement provided more specifics about the forthcoming implementation of the registration requirement, including additional guidance on who is required to register and the process to register.\n\nHowever, that guidance (detailed below) contains some conflicting and incomplete information. The Interim Final Regulation will need to be carefully reviewed when it is published, as the regulation– not a website announcement– will ultimately govern the registration requirement and process.\n\nRegistration\n\nRegistration is not an immigration status, and registration documentation does not establish employment authorization or any other right or benefit under the INA or other laws.\n\nWhile the majority of noncitizens have already registered, many noncitizens in the United States have not had a direct way to register and meet the registration requirement under the INA.\n\nWho has already registered?\n\nAny noncitizen who has received a document listed in 8 CFR § 264.1(b) is considered as already registered and in compliance with the INA:\n\nWho must apply for registration with the new system?\n\nWho is not registered?\n\nIndividuals who are considered not registered and who must register via the new system to be in compliance with the registration requirement include:\n\nHow to register?\n\nUSCIS is creating a registration process to facilitate compliance. At this time, USCIS has requested that noncitizens create an USCIS online account to prepare for the registration process. Once DHS finalizes the form and registration process, registration applications will be submitted through the USCIS portal.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe new registration requirement forces “unregistered” noncitizens to choose between two risky options. Choosing to submit the designated form to the federal government, once it is available, may put them at risk of being placed in removal proceedings. On the other hand, choosing not to register may put them at risk of future criminal prosecution for failing to register if they are apprehended by law enforcement at a later point.\n\nAdditionally, it raises the possibility that noncitizens who are already registered—including those with legal status—may be arrested for failing to carry proof of their registration with them at all times or failing to provide it to law enforcement when asked.\n\nIt is essential that individuals who may be affected by this policy consult with a competent and reputable immigration lawyer, if at all possible, to receive the most appropriate advice for their circumstances. Vialto will continue to monitor for the issuance of USCIS’ proposed regulation on the registration requirement and will then provide further information and guidance.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nManish Daftari\nPartner\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nThe US Embassy and Consulates General have announced several important changes to consular processing. These changes include updates to scheduling procedures, interview waiver criteria, and communication preferences. These updates are outlined below.\n\nThe detail\n\nUS Consular posts in Asia, Europe and the Middle East have announced important updates\n\nThe US Embassy and Consulates General of India has announced new criteria for nonimmigrant visa interview (“Dropbox”) waivers\nInterview waivers (often referred to as the “Dropbox”) were previously available to individuals whose prior visa stamp in the same category was either still valid or had expired within 48 months. Now, The US Consulate General in India has announced that interview waivers are only available to those whose visa stamps are either still valid or have expired within 12 months.\n\nThe US Embassy and Consulates General of China has announced that it will open new nonimmigrant visa appointments\nThe new nonimmigrant visa interview appointments are available according to the following schedule:\n\nA new visa services system went into effect across a number of Middle East countries\nThe new visa services system went into effect on February 8, 2025 in Pakistan, Egypt, Nepal, Qatar, and Kuwait. More details regarding these changes can be found at USTravelDocs.com.\n\nThe US Embassy in London has implemented a visa navigator tool\nThe new visa navigator tool on their webpage is intended to help direct communications. It limits the types of questions that one may submit to the embassy and is intended to improve overall efficiency.\n\nThe US Embassy in Amsterdam will be temporarily closed\nThe closure is expected to last from March 2025 to May 2025 and is the result of building renovations.\n\nWhat this means\n\nUnder a new presidential administration, we can expect to see continual process changes at consular posts. The biggest change this week is the limitations on the use of the “Dropbox” interview waiver process in India. This change will require more visa applicants to apply for in-person interview appointments and consequently increase appointment backlogs at the consular posts in India.

        "date": "April 2, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nUnited States | USCIS announces H-1B cap selections; Petitions filing window runs April 1 – June 30\n\nThe United States Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS) has made its final selections for the FY25 H-1B cap and has notified all sponsoring employers and legal representatives of selected beneficiaries through their respective USCIS Organizational Accounts. Petitions may be filed online starting April 1 or paper filed petitions may be mailed to the specified lockbox. USCIS must receive all petitions by June 30 to be considered. Petitions must adhere to the new fee schedule and use the Form I-129 dated 04/01/2024. USCIS will be hosting additional Tech Talks for stakeholders on April 2, April 4. April 16, and April 30.\n\nH-1B Cap Selections\nUSCIS has made its final selections for the FY25 H-1B cap lottery. USCIS had begun notifying selected registrants on March 27, but has just confirmed that as of April 1, that all selections have been made.  While sponsoring employers and legal representatives are now able to view the results through the online Organizational Account system, glitches in the USCIS system may prevent the full selections from being viewable. USCIS is actively investigating the issue.\n\nUSCIS has not yet announced the number of lottery registrations for FY25; however, when the new fee change rule was announced, the Department of Homeland Security had revised the USCIS volume forecast for H–1B registration workload to 424,400 registrations for FY25. The total number of  FY24 eligible registrations was 758,994 (consisting of 408,891 eligible beneficiaries with multiple registrations and 350,103 eligible beneficiaries with no other eligible registrations). USCIS generally provides registration and selection percentage data in the summer; historical data for past registrations and selections is available on the USCIS website.\n\nH-1B Cap Petitions\nThe 90-day H-1B cap petition filing window runs April 1 through June 30, 2024.\n\nPetitions must be filed using the 04/01/2024 edition of the Form I-129 and adhere to the new fee schedule summarized in our New USCIS fee alert. Specifically, in addition to the I-129 filing fee, the ACWIA fee, and the Fraud fee, employers are subject to an Asylum Program fee of USD $600 (reduced to $300 for smaller employers and not applicable to nonprofit employers). H-1B cap petitions are eligible for premium processing, resulting in adjudication within 15 business (rather than calendar) days for a fee of $2,805.\n\nAlthough USCIS has advised there will be no difference in the adjudication timeline for online versus paper filed petitions, USCIS offers a fee discount of $50 for petitions filed online. Paper petitions will no longer be accepted at the USCIS Service Centers, but instead must be mailed to the lockbox designated on the  Form I-129 Direct Filing Addresses page on the USCIS website.\n\nDue to the increased filing volumes USCIS typically experiences during the H-1B cap filing period, USCIS has cautioned that receipt notices might be delayed. USCIS has advised to only reach out to the USCIS Contact Center where more than 30 days have passed since confirmation of the petition delivery.\n\nH-1B cap petitions may begin to be filed for beneficiaries selected in the lottery. With the newly launched Organizational Account system that offers online filing, this year petitions may be filed online or paper filings may be mailed to the appropriate USCIS lockbox using the new edition of the Form I-129 (04/01/2024 edition). USCIS has advised that receipt notices might be delayed due to the increase in filing volume during the H-1B cap petition filing period.\n\nUSCIS will be hosting additional Tech Talks discussing the online filing process on April 2, April 4. April 16, and April 30.\n\nFor information concerning the new Form I-129 and the increased filing fees, please refer to our New USCIS fee alert.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nManish Daftari\nPartner\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit: www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nContact us on the following address:  me-immigration@vialto.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "December 7, 2023",
        "content": "Updated information as at 8 December 2023 from our previous news alert dated 5 December 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nMalaysia | Introduction of Digital Arrival Card, Expansion of Autogate Facilities and Implementation of Visa Liberalisation Plan\n\nImpact: Medium\n\nSummary\n\nReferring to the latest announcement made by the Malaysian Immigration Department (MID), effective 1 December 2023, all foreign nationals are required to submit their Malaysia Digital Arrival Card (MDAC) within three days prior to arrival in Malaysia, except for certain categories of individuals.\n\nThe autogate facilities are extended and available for foreign nationals from 10 countries for arrival and departures at KLIA 1, KLIA 2 and all gazetted international checkpoints.\n\nFollowing the recent Malaysia budget announcement on 13 October 2023, the Malaysian Government has now laid out the initiatives under the Malaysian Visa Liberalisation Plan which include visa exemption for Chinese and Indian nationals travelling to Malaysia for social visit, expansion of visa validity and duration, introduction of Umrah Transit Visa and Graduate Social Visit Pass. This Plan is aimed at promoting the entry of foreign nationals into Malaysia to boost the country’s economy and maintain Malaysia’s strong position especially in the investment and tourism industries within the region.\n\nThe Detail\n\nMalaysia Digital Arrival Card\n\nThe Malaysia Digital Arrival Card (MDAC) has been introduced since 1 December 2023 and will be made mandatory from 1 January 2024 onwards for all foreign nationals entering Malaysia. Foreign nationals are required to submit the MDAC via this website within three days before arriving in Malaysia, except for the following categories of individuals:\n\n● Malaysian Permanent Residents and Long Term Pass holders;\n● Citizens of Singapore;\n● Diplomatic and Official Passport holders;\n● General Certificate of Identity (GCI) Brunei Darussalam holders;\n● Brunei Malaysia Frequent Traveller Facility holders;\n● Thailand Border Pass holders; and\n● Indonesia Cross-Border Travel Document (PLB) holders.\n\nExpansion of Autogate Facilities\n\nThe autogate facilities at KLIA 1, KLIA 2 and all gazetted international checkpoints have been expanded to foreign nationals from 10 countries which includes Australia, South Korea, United States, Brunei, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and Singapore. For the first entry into Malaysia, eligible foreign nationals will not be able to use the autogate and will be required to submit the MDAC within three days before arriving in Malaysia, followed by verification of the passport at the manual counter which is a one time process before they are able to use the autogate to depart from Malaysia and for subsequent visits to Malaysia.\n\nPrior to this, the autogate facilities were primarily available for Malaysian citizens and this initiative will help to ease the entry process into Malaysia for eligible foreign nationals.\n\nVisa Liberalisation Plan\n\nThe following initiatives have been laid out by the Malaysian Government under the Visa Liberalisation Plan:\n\n\n\nInitiatives\n\n\n\nImplementation Period\n\n\n\nDetails\n\n\n\n31 December 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nThis exemption does not apply for those entering Malaysia for employment or education purposes and a visa with reference must be obtained prior to entry into Malaysia.\n\n\n\n31 December 2026\n\n\n\n31 December 2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther extension of the Social Visit Pass duration is not allowed.\n\n\n\n31 December 2026\n\n\n\n31 December 2026\n\n\n\naccompanying dependants are eligible to apply for a Long Term Social Pass under this facility.\n\n\n\nThe conditions for the Pass application are as follows:\n\n\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe introduction of MDAC and the expansion of the autogate facilities are expected to increase efficiency and reduce the overall time spent at the entry points of Malaysia. These initiatives are in line with the Government’s aim to ease the entry process and attract more foreign visitors and investors into Malaysia for the purpose of boosting the country’s economy. Similarly, the Visa Liberalisation plan will enhance and promote the entry process into Malaysia to facilitate investment and tourism activities in a speedy manner. The introduction of the Graduate Social Visit Pass will also enrich the talent pool in Malaysia, especially in meeting the needs of the industry’s skilled manpower by providing job opportunities to eligible foreign graduates.\n\nHow we can help\n\nOur team is closely monitoring the implementation of the above-mentioned immigration developments and we will be able to support you in understanding how these new initiatives will benefit your organisation and employees, including the new pass applications as introduced by the Malaysian authorities.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nSasha Reddy\nPartner\nsasha.reddy@vialto.com\n\nHana Rabi\nSenior Manager \nhana.rabi@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com",

        "content": "24 February 2023\n\nThe Malaysia re-tabled Budget 2023 announcement on 24 February 2023 by the Prime Minister and Finance Minister, YAB Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim, takes a responsible and balanced approach to reinforce the drive for inclusive and sustainable economic growth, equipping Malaysia to withstand the current global economic headwinds without compromising the rakyat’s well-being. The fiscal measures comprise a good mix of proposals addressing the high cost of living and protecting the more vulnerable segments of the population while progressively introducing a broadened tax base with an increased revenue collection focus.\n\nIn this Alert, we will cover the key reforms and measures that will impact individual taxpayers and employers.\n\nWhile the Budget focuses on striking a balance between fiscal management and the welfare of the people, the widespread reset of fiscal reforms aimed at elite income earners, such as the uptrend in tax rates at the highest income bands, luxury goods tax and the potential introduction of capital gains tax on the disposal of unlisted shares, may have an impact on investment activities and attracting highly skilled talents to Malaysia.\n\nVoluntary Disclosure Programme\n\nThe programme is to be administered by the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board (MIRB) from 1 June 2023 until 31 May 2024. There will be a full remission of penalties.\n\nAt the time of writing, it is unclear whether there are any criteria to be met before the penalties are waived.\n\nThe programme offers a chance for individual taxpayers and companies to come forward and make good of the gaps arising from their respective tax reporting obligations. From a global mobility perspective, such gaps can arise due to non-visibility of split or offshore payroll arrangements, incorrect application of domestic and treaty exemptions, offshore trailing income and under remittance of monthly tax deduction.\n\nComing clean with the tax authorities will pave the way forward for employers and individuals to strengthen their fiscal responsibilities.\n\nKey individual tax measures\n\nIndividual tax rates for tax resident\n\nIn an attempt to narrow the income gap, the proposed changes to individual income tax rates for tax residents comprise the lowering of tax rates for the lower income groups, and the merging of and increase in tax rates for the higher income bands.\n\n\n\n(MYR)\n\n\n\n(Tax Savings) /\n\nTax Increase\n\nMYR\n\nEmployers need to ensure that their payroll systems are updated with the new tax rates and chargeable income bands once the Finance Bill is passed into law, to ensure that their employees’ monthly taxes are calculated accurately, as well as communicated accordingly to their employees. Y/A 2023 tax returns that have already been filed in the tax clearance process must be revised and finalised through amended assessments.\n\nSpecial tax rate of 15% for C-Suite employees\n\nExtension of special tax rate of 15% for C-Suite employees in electrical and electronic manufacturing companies relocating their operations to Malaysia until Y/A 2024.\n\nTax deduction for contribution to sport industry\n\nUp to 10% deduction from aggregate income for donations to non-profit organisations implementing sports development programs at the grassroots level.\n\nPersonal tax reliefs\n\nExpansion\n\nMedical expenses for self, spouse or child is expanded to include intervention expenditure for learning disabilities** up to MYR4,000. Overall limit is also increased from MYR8,000 to MYR10,000 from Y/A 2023\n\n**Autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Global Developmental Delay (GDD), Intellectual Disability, Down Syndrome and Specific Learning Disabilities\n\nExpansion\n\nRelief for life insurance premium/ takaful contributions is expanded to cover voluntary contributions to EPF from Y/A 2023\n\nExtension\n\nRelief for fees paid to child care centre and kindergarten is extended to Y/A 2024\n\nOther related tax measures\n\nHiring Incentives\n\nCorporate tax deductions for employers hiring senior citizens, former convicts, parolees, and supervised persons (with conditions met) will be expanded to include inmates/ former inmates of Henry Gurney School under the Malaysian Prison Department, protection and rehabilitation institution and registered care centres under the Social Welfare Department (from Ys/A 2023 until 2025).\n\nMicro, Small and Medium Industries (MSME **) Tax Rates\n\nFrom Y/A 2023, income tax rates for MSME are amended to\n\n** Companies with paid up capital of ordinary shares ≤ MYR 2.5 million, or Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) with total contribution of capital ≤ MYR 2.5 million and having gross business income ≤ MYR 50 million.\n\nWith the proposed changes in individual and MSME income tax rates, the disparity between the income tax paid as a small business owner and a MSME corporation has widened further\n\nKey labour measures\n\nIndividuals/ Self-Employed/ Gig Workers\n\nCognisant of the rising costs of living, the Budget aims to provide additional social protection and increase retirement savings for the self-employed, with this first step of mandating the Self-Employment Social Security Scheme in stages.\n\nMalaysian Employers\n\nWhile we await the draft Finance Bill 2023 to see what other amendments the Budget may bring, please join us for our Mobility Roundup webinar at 2.30pm on Friday, 3 March 2023 (register here) as we discuss the Budget announcement measures that impact employers and employees in Malaysia.\n\nHilda Liow\n\nPartner\n\nhilda.liow.wun.chee@vialto.com\n\nLim Phing Phing\n\nPartner\n\nphing.phing.lim@vialto.com\n\nSasha Reddy\n\nPartner\n\nsasha.reddy@vialto.com\n\nWee Lay Har\n\nDirector\n\nlay.har.wee@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Canada | Immigration | Changes to visa requirements for Mexican citizens",
        "date": "March 13, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nCanada: Changes to visa requirements for Mexican citizens\n\n****La version française suit la version anglaise****\n\nSummary\nThe Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship announced today that the Government of Canada will be reintroducing visitor visa requirements for Mexican citizens. Effective today, Mexican passport holders will need a valid visa to enter Canada unless they currently hold a valid US visa or have held a Canadian visa in the last ten years.\n\nThe Detail\nAs of February 29, 2024, at 11:30 p.m. Eastern Time (ET), Mexican citizens who hold a valid US non-immigrant visa or have held a Canadian visa in the past 10 years, and are traveling by air on a Mexican passport will be able to apply for an electronic travel authorization (eTA). Those who do not meet these conditions will need to apply for a Canadian visitor visa.\n\nFurther, existing eTAs held by Mexican citizens will be automatically canceled unless they are held in conjunction with a valid work or study permit. Mexican citizens who wish to apply for a Canadian study or work permit can do so online. Because of the new measure, Mexican citizens will no longer be eligible to apply for their work permits at a port of entry, i.e., at an airport and/or a land border.\n\nMexican citizens with existing eTAs or pending a decision on their eTAs who do not currently hold a valid work or study permit will be required to submit a fresh application for an eTA or a visitor visa. Applicants must wait until after 11:30 p.m. ET on February 29, 2024, to apply for a visitor visa or re-apply for an eTA.\n\nWhat this means\nMexican citizens in Canada with a valid study permit or work permit should not be affected and will keep their current valid eTA to allow their entry to Canada via air. They can continue to study and work in Canada based on the conditions of their permit. Note, however, that a visa will still be required for travel via land or sea.\n\nMexican citizens in Canada without a study or work permit can continue to remain in Canada for the  authorized validity of their stay, however their eTAs will be canceled. If they wish to return to Canada, they will need to apply for a new eTA (if eligible) or visitor visa.\n\nThose seeking to apply for a new work permit will need to do so online. As such, employers and foreign nationals should prepare for longer processing times.\n\nWant to learn more?\nFor further details regarding this, or any other immigration matter, please contact a member of our team at Vialto Partners LLP.\n\nI’immigration\n\nCanada:Modifications aux exigences de visa pour les citoyens mexicains\n\nEn bref\nL’honorable Marc Miller, ministre de l’Immigration, des Réfugiés et de la Citoyenneté, a annoncé aujourd’hui que le gouvernement du Canada rétablira les exigences en matière de visa de visiteur pour les citoyens mexicains. À compter d’aujourd’hui, les détenteurs de passeport Mexicain auront besoin d’un visa valide pour entrer au Canada, sauf s’ils détiennent actuellement un visa américain valide ou s’ils ont obtenu un visa canadien au cours des dix dernières années.\n\nEn détail\nÀ partir du 29 février 2024, à 23h30, heure de l’Est (HE), les citoyens mexicains titulaires d’un visa de non-immigrant des États-Unis valide ou qui ont détenu un visa canadien au cours des 10 dernières années, et qui voyagent par avion avec un passeport mexicain pourront demander une autorisation de voyage électronique (AVE). Ceux qui ne remplissent pas ces conditions devront demander un visa d’entrée canadien.\n\nDe plus, les AVE existantes détenues par des citoyens mexicains seront automatiquement annulées, à moins qu’elles n’aient été détenues conjointement avec un permis de travail ou d’études valide. Les citoyens mexicains qui souhaitent demander un permis d’études ou de travail canadien peuvent le faire en ligne. En raison de cette nouvelle mesure, les citoyens mexicains ne pourront plus faire une demande de permis de travail à un point d’entrée, c’est-à-dire à un aéroport et/ou à une frontière terrestre.\n\nLes citoyens mexicains disposant d’une AVE existante ou en attente d’une décision concernant leur AVE et qui ne détiennent pas actuellement de permis de travail ou d’études valide devront soumettre une nouvelle demande d’AVE ou de visa de visiteur. Les candidats devront attendre après 23h30 HE le 29 février 2024, pour demander un visa de visiteur ou présenter une nouvelle demande d’AVE.\n\nQu’est-ce que cela signifie\nLes citoyens mexicains au Canada possédant un permis d’études ou un permis de travail valide ne devraient pas être affectés et conserveront leur AVE valide actuelle pour permettre leur entrée au Canada par voie aérienne. Ils peuvent continuer à étudier et travailler au Canada selon les conditions de leur permis. Notez cependant qu’un visa sera toujours nécessaire pour voyager par voie terrestre ou maritime.\n\nLes citoyens mexicains au Canada sans permis d’études ou de travail peuvent continuer à résider au Canada pendant la validité autorisée de leur séjour, cependant, leur AVE sera annulée. S’ils souhaitent revenir au Canada, ils devront demander une nouvelle AVE (si éligible) ou un visa de visiteur.\n\nCeux qui cherchent à demander un nouveau permis de travail devront le faire en ligne. Ainsi, les employeurs et les ressortissants étrangers devront se préparer à des délais de traitement plus longs.\n\nVous voulez en savoir plus?\nPour plus d’informations sur ce qui précède ou sur toute autre question relative à l’immigration, veuillez contacter un membre de notre équipe chez Vialto Associés.\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Germany | Determination of taxable and tax-free wages for payroll purposes",
        "date": "October 29, 2024",
        "content": "Tax\n\nSummary\n\nOn October 8, 2020, the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) published a new circular letter that contains significant changes for determining tax-free and taxable wages in payroll for cross-border activities from January 1, 2025. This circular replaces some of the regulations of the previous circular dated March 14, 2017. The circular also contains clarifications regarding the practical application of the per diem payroll scale.\n\nIn addition, the circular now officially confirms that, for reasons of simplification, there will be no objections if the per diem scale (for taxable salary for certain days in the payroll month) is not applied until the end of 2024. If a lower wage tax results without applying the per diem scale, a correction and adjustment can be made until the wage tax certificate is issued.\n\nWe have summarized the most important changes for you below, along with an example of how to determine the wage tax deduction.\n\nThe detail\n\nThe payroll tax guideline R 39b.5 (2) sentence 4 for 2023 stipulates that the wage tax deduction is to be made according to the per diem scale instead of the monthly scale, provided that the employee receives taxable and tax-free wages. In practice, this has led to a lot of uncertainty. The circular from October 8, 2024 (IV C 5 – S 2367/23/100001 :001) has now provided additional clarity.\n\nIf an employer pays their employee wages that are partially tax-exempt and partially taxable according to a double taxation agreement (DTA), the employer must first determine the directly attributable wages for the purposes of calculating the wage tax to be withheld and treat them as tax-exempt or taxable accordingly. The employer must then divide the remaining and not directly attributable wages into a tax-exempt and a taxable portion.\n\nFor the purpose of payroll during the year, the circular contains the following alternatives for determining the taxable and tax-free wages to be allocated:\n\nThe employer must choose one of these options for payroll purposes and cannot change it during the year.\n\nThe days used for the daily wage tax calculation (tax days) can be determined according to the ratio of calendar days to total working days. For reasons of simplification, it can be assumed that full-time employees work 20 total working days per month. A factor of 1.5 can be applied for the purpose of converting the salary for the actual working day (30 calendar days / 20 total working days). This is reduced accordingly if the employee works part-time.\n\nFor other payments that cannot be directly assigned to tax-exempt or taxable wages, a distribution must be made according to the circumstances in the vesting period. If it is a one-time payment, such as a bonus payment, the annual scale is to be used; for other current payments, the per diem scale is to be used.\n\nAt the end of the calendar year, the employer must review the wage tax deduction carried out and correct it in the event of deviations. A new aspect is that the correction must be made retroactively for each individual calendar month, which results in an increased workload for the employer.\n\nHowever, it remains unclear whether an abbreviated period can be considered in the case of changes in the circumstances through the year, i.e. in the case of the start of a secondment during the calendar year with a higher salary structure (see circular letter dated December 12, 2023, para. 239 analogously).\n\nFinally, the circular emphasizes that the national subject-to-tax clauses of Section 50d (8) and (9) German income tax act and the subject-to-tax clauses contained in DTAs are not to be considered in the context of the wage tax deduction procedure.\n\nExample\n\nThe employee receives a monthly salary of EUR 5,000. Taking into account weekends, public holidays and vacation days, 224 actual working days result. The employee is expected to work for 60 days in the calendar year abroad (assumption: the taxation right is with the host country) and 164 days in Germany. Thus, by way of example, a salary of EUR 3,666.71 (164/224 x EUR 5,000) would be taxable in Germany for the month of January.\n\nThe wage tax is to be calculated according to the day table as follows: 30 days x 164/224 = 21.96 days and rounded down to 21. The daily wage tax is to be determined for the amount of EUR 174.32 (EUR 3,666.71/ 21 days) and this daily wage tax is to be multiplied by 21.\n\n\n\nTax\n\nZusammenfassung\n\nDas Bundesministerium der Finanzen (BMF) hat am 8. Oktober 2024 ein neues Schreiben veröffentlicht, das wesentliche Änderungen zur Ermittlung des steuerfreien und steuerpflichtigen Arbeitslohns im Lohnsteuerverfahren bei grenzüberschreitenden Tätigkeiten ab dem 1. Januar 2025 beinhaltet. Dieses Schreiben ersetzt einige Regelungen des vorangegangenen Schreibens vom 14. März 2017. Das Schreiben beinhaltet auch Klarstellungen zur praktischen Anwendung der Tagestabelle.\n\nZudem bestätigt das Schreiben nun offiziell, dass es aus Vereinfachungsgründen nicht beanstandet wird, wenn die Tagestabelle (bei nur tageweise steuerpflichtigem Arbeitslohn im Abrechnungsmonat) bis Ende 2024 nicht angewendet wird. Sofern sich ohne Anwendung der Tagestabelle eine niedrigere Lohnsteuer ergibt, kann eine Berichtigung und Korrektur bis zur Ausstellung der Lohnsteuerbescheinigung erfolgen.\n\nDie wichtigsten Änderungen sowie die exemplarische Ermittlung für den Lohnsteuerabzug haben wir Ihnen nachfolgend zusammengefasst.\n\nIm Detail\n\nDie Lohnsteuerrichtlinie R 39b.5 Abs. 2 Satz 4 2023 sieht vor, dass der Lohnsteuerabzug nach der Tagestabelle statt bisher nach der Monatstabelle erfolgt, sofern der Arbeitnehmer neben steuerpflichtigen auch steuerfreien Arbeitslohn bezieht. Dies führte bezüglich der Anwendung in der Praxis zu vielen Unsicherheiten. Das BMF-Schreiben vom 8. Oktober 2024 (IV C 5 – S 2367/23/100001 :001) verschafft nun mehr Klarheit.\n\nZahlt der Arbeitgeber seinem Arbeitnehmer Arbeitslohn, der nach einem Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen (DBA) teilweise steuerfrei und teilweise steuerpflichtig ist, so hat der Arbeitgeber für den vorzunehmenden Lohnsteuerabzug zunächst den direkt zuordenbaren Arbeitslohn zu ermitteln und entsprechend als steuerfrei oder steuerpflichtig zu behandeln. Sodann hat der Arbeitgeber den verbleibenden und nicht direkt zuordenbaren Arbeitslohn in einen steuerfreien und einen steuerpflichtigen Teil aufzuteilen.\n\nFür die unterjährigen Durchführung des laufenden Lohnsteuerabzugs beinhaltet das BMF-Schreiben die nachfolgenden Alternativen zur Ermittlung dieses aufzuteilenden steuerfreien und steuerpflichtigen Arbeitslohn:\n\nFür die Lohnabrechnung ist eine Alternative zu wählen, ein unterjähriger Wechsel ist nicht zulässig.\n\nDie für die tageweise Lohnsteuerberechnung maßgeblichen Tage (sogenannte Steuertage) können nach dem Verhältnis der Kalendertage zu den Gesamtarbeitstagen ermittelt werden. Aus Vereinfachungsgründen kann bei Vollzeit beschäftigten Arbeitnehmern von 20 Gesamtarbeitstagen im Monat ausgegangen werden. Für Zwecke der Umrechnung des Arbeitslohns kann der voraussichtlich tatsächliche Arbeitstag mit einem Faktor von 1,5 angesetzt werden (30 Kalendertage/ 20 Gesamtarbeitstage). Dies verringert sich entsprechend, wenn der Arbeitnehmer in Teilzeit arbeitet.\n\nBei sonstigen Bezügen, die nicht direkt dem steuerfreien oder steuerpflichtigen Arbeitslohn zugeordnet werden können, ist eine Aufteilung nach den Verhältnissen im Erdienungszeitraum vorzunehmen. Handelt es sich um einen Einmalbezug, bspw. Bonuszahlung, so ist die Jahrestabelle anzuwenden, bei laufenden sonstigen Bezügen die Tagestabelle.\n\nAm Ende des Kalenderjahres hat der Arbeitgeber den durchgeführten Lohnsteuerabzug zu überprüfen und bei Abweichungen zu korrigieren. Neu ist, dass die Korrektur rückwirkend für jeden einzelnen Kalendermonat vorzunehmen ist, was zu einem erhöhten Arbeitsaufwand auf Arbeitgeberseite führt.\n\nUnklar bleibt jedoch, ob bei unterschiedlichen Gegebenheiten während des Jahres, d.h. bei unterjähriger Entsendung mit höherem Gehaltsgefüge, ein verkürzter Zeitraum zu betrachten wäre (BMF-Schreiben vom 12. Dezember 2023, Rn. 239 analog).\n\nZuletzt betont das Schreiben, dass die nationalen Rückfallklauseln des § 50d Abs. 8 und Abs. 9 EStG sowie die im DBA enthaltenen Rückfallklauseln nicht im Rahmen des Lohnsteuerabzugsverfahren zu prüfen sind.\n\nBeispiel\n\nDer Arbeitnehmer erhält monatlich eine Vergütung von EUR 5.000. Unter Berücksichtigung von Wochenenden, Feiertagen und Urlaubstagen verbleiben 224 tatsächliche Arbeitstage. Der Arbeitnehmer arbeitet im Kalenderjahr voraussichtlich an 60 Tagen im Ausland (Annahme: Besteuerungsrecht hierfür liegt im Ausland) und 164 Tage im Inland. Somit wäre exemplarisch für den Monat Januar ein Arbeitslohn von EUR 3.666,71 (164/224 x EUR 5.000) in Deutschland steuerpflichtig.\n\nDie Lohnsteuer ist nach der Tagestabelle wie folgt zu berechnen: 30 Tage x 164/224 = 21,96 Tage und auf 21 abzurunden. Für den Betrag von EUR 174,32 (EUR 3.666,71/ 21 Tage) ist die Tageslohnsteuer zu ermitteln und diese Tageslohnsteuer ist mit 21 zu vervielfachen.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMathias Schmitt\nPartner\n\nDamaris Besenreuther\nSenior Manager\n\nAlekandra Amedov\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "GCC | Immigration | Introduction of Unified Visa for GCC Countries",
        "date": "November 15, 2023",
        "content": "14 November 2023\n\nImpact Medium\n\nSummary\n\nGCC member countries – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates – have taken a significant step towards regional integration by introducing the Unified GCC Visa.\n\nThis groundbreaking initiative, which was announced by GCC President Sayyed Hamoud bin Faisal Al Busaidi during the 40th meeting of the Interior Ministers earlier this month, which aims to simplify the visa process for individuals visiting member countries, fostering economic growth, and strengthening ties within the Gulf region.\n\nFrom an immigration standpoint, a unified visa will facilitate the movement of residents and tourists across the GCC. Subject to systems being successfully implemented in all six countries, the new Unified Visa is set to launch between 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe Detail\n\nCurrently travellers are required to navigate individual visa requirements for each GCC country. The Unified Visa aims to streamline these requirements and processes, making it easier for individuals to plan and execute cross-border travel.\n\nFor the tourism sector, the Unified GCC Visa represents a significant change. With a single visa granting access to multiple member states, tourists will be able to explore the region seamlessly. This unified approach promotes the GCC as a collective tourism destination.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, the Unified GCC Visa enhances the ease of conducting cross border operations. Business professionals can now attend meetings, conferences, and events across the GCC with a single visa, reducing administrative burdens and fostering stronger economic ties among member countries.\n\nThe Unified GCC Visa also has positive implications for families spread across member states. Streamlined immigration processes make it easier for family members to visit or reunite.\n\nWhile the Unified GCC Visa brings numerous advantages, challenges may arise in implementing and managing the unified system. Harmonising immigration policies and ensuring consistent application procedures are critical to its success. Additionally, addressing security concerns and monitoring visa overstays will be paramount to maintaining the integrity of the system.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThere could be parallels with the Schengen Visa system which facilitates border-free travel among 27 European countries in the Schengen Area. The system promotes common rules for visa issuance and border control; travellers from non-Schengen countries may need a Schengen Visa for short stays, allowing entry to any Schengen country. The Schengen Information System enables information sharing among member states, and the Interior Ministers of the GCC has also approved the electronic linking of traffic offences across the six countries.\n\nThe Schengen Visa system has facilitated the ease of travel across European countries for certain nationalities, and the GCC’s Unified Visa system aims to achieve this whilst also boosting the economy and tourism. By simplifying visa procedures it is expected that the new system will have great appeal for residents and tourists alike.\n\nHow we can help\n\nShould you have any questions in relation to the introduction of the GCC Unified Visa and how Vialto can help, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nContact us\n\nShould you have further questions on this update, please reach out to:\n\nAnir Chatterji\nEMEA Immigration Partner\nanir.chatterji@vialto.com\n\nRekha Simpson\nDirector, Middle East Immigration\nrekha.simpson@vialto.com\n\nRens Jongerius\nManager, Middle East Immigration\nrens.jongerius@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com",

        "date": "May 23, 2024",
        "content": "Tax and immigration\n\nUnited Kingdom | UK Prime Minister calls a general election\n\nSummary\n\nThe UK Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, has called a General Election. It seems probable that tax and immigration will be debated at length over the coming months and that the next Government will reform existing rules.\n\nThe detail\n\nThe UK Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, has called a General Election to take place on 4 July 2024. It is highly probable that rules relating to tax and immigration will feature heavily in debates and manifestos for all of the main parties, over the coming months.\n\nIt is too early to know precisely what will be promised to the electorate, but we expect that:\n\n● The incumbent Conservative Party is likely to focus on immigration policies relating to asylum seekers and refugees. Prime Minister Sunak will likely come under pressure from migration sceptics in his party to promise severely cut and perhaps cap migration numbers; that pressure will be counterbalanced by economic arguments for continued flows of skilled workers, students and others to the UK. It remains to be seen where the balance will lie, but at the very least a promise to continue to reduce net migration is likely.\n● The opposition Labour Party has not signalled a major overhaul of the UK immigration system but they are likely to say that sponsorship of overseas workers will be contingent on that employer investing in the recruitment or development of local workers. It is not clear how or when this investment could be evidenced. On asylum, they are likely to point to recently announced plans for a new Border Security Command and other measures to help prevent dangerous crossings to the UK (generally talked about in relation to “small boats” carrying potential asylum seekers).\n● Tax policy will be one of the central levers used by all parties to try and influence votes. Following a cost of living crisis and period of high inflation – more than ever – the ability to impact someone’s take home pay is likely to carry significant sway. Whilst the tax policies may vary – an overall theme of simplicity, fairness and equality is likely to be prevalent across the parties.\n● We were expecting a tax-cutting Autumn Budget from the Conservatives, but the election has thrown this into doubt. Tthe earlier election date is likely to see further tax cut promises being tabled by the Conservative leader – who will continue to feel pressure to reduce the overall tax\n● Whilst the Labour Party have been vocal about how individuals face the highest tax burden in 70 years under the Conservative Government, they may find it difficult to make tax cuts, given the financial headroom available – and the difficult task of balancing tax vs spending. We can however expect to see more focus on closing perceived tax loopholes.\n● One area Labour has been clear on intention to reform for some time is the non-domicile rules – and they have already stated that they will go further than the reforms proposed by the Conservatives in the last Budget. With the new rules due to come into place from 6 April 2025, an earlier Election will at least give them more time to influence the new rules effectively, if they do come into power. In either case – knowing which Party will be in power sooner, will give businesses and individuals more clarity on what the final rules are likely to be – and therefore more time to plan.\n● Among the other parties, it is likely that:\n○ the Scottish National Party (SNP) will call for more immigration into Scotland;\n○ the Liberal Democrats Party may build on their usual push for a fairer immigration system;\n○ The Green Party will likely call for a fairer and more humane approach to migration plus a refocus on taxes away from income to wealth; and\n○ the pro-Brexit Reform Party are likely to lead on asylum but also promise to freeze ‘non-essential immigration, instead targeting doctors and a small number of other skill sets.\n\nWe have taken our expectations from a variety of media and other sources. It is highly likely that plans will variously change or evolve as we approach the election and we will provide a more certain briefing when party manifestors have been published.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nLyudmyla Davies\nPartner (Solicitor)\n\nIan Robinson\nPartner\n\nAndrea Als\nDirector (Solicitor)\n\nTom Marsom\nDirector (Solicitor)\n\nLucy Vaux\nSenior Manager (Solicitor)\n\nAsh Majithia\nPartner\n\nConor Tobin\nDirector\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "May 30, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nUAE | Emiratisation update summary\n\nSummary\n\nIn line with the UAE Cabinet’s Resolution No (19/5m) of 2022 to revise the mechanism for achieving Emiratisation targets by 2026, private companies are reminded about the need to ensure they meet their Emiratisation rates every six months. Companies that fail to meet Emiratisation rates will be required to make bi-annual contributions and the Ministry of Human Resource and Emiratisation (MOHRE) has set a deadline of 30 June 2024 to meet Emiratisation rates for the first half of 2024.\n\nThe Detail\n\nCompanies operating in the UAE Mainland employing 50 or more workers, must meet their Emiratisation rates bi-annually, to achieve an overall Emiratisation target of 10% by the end of 2026. Those who fall short will need to make contributions accordingly.\n\nWhilst Mainland establishments are required to achieve a 6% Emiratisation rate by the end of 2024, companies must ensure that at least 5% of their skilled workforce comprises of Emirati nationals by 30 June 2024 (and the remaining 1% by the end of this year). Those establishments that do not comply will risk paying ‘financial contributions’, and this will be enforced from 1 July along with the Ministry starting to monitor companies’ compliance.\n\nCompanies that fail to meet the targets will face monthly contributions of AED 8,000 for each unfilled Emirati position this year, totalling AED 48,000 to be paid within the first six months and the remaining AED 48,000 to be paid by the end of the year (total of AED 96,000 annually). The contribution amounts for companies that violate the Emiratisation scheme will be calculated and enforced starting from 1 July 2024. Additionally, contribution amounts for companies that do not comply with the scheme in 2022 and 2023 will continue to be collected; this will be stated in Tawteen reports shared by the MOHRE by email with the registered authorised signatory, or available on the company’s MOHRE’s app.\n\nWhat this means\n\nBy 30 June 2024, companies must have 5% Emirati nationals in their skilled workforce and work towards achieving an additional 1% target by year end. Failure to pay penalties on time may result in additional administrative penalties and the inability to sponsor expatriates resulting from portal blocks. Companies are categorised based on their adherence to Emiratisation, and consistent non-compliance may lead to the organisation being downgraded to  category 3, resulting in higher work permit charges.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe understand that for many companies this will require careful workforce planning. We can help to:\n● Advise on your Emiratisation targets and how to ensure compliance;\n● Conduct impact assessments based on your existing employee population;\n● Keep you updated on evolving requirements in the region, ensuring compliance with government announcements and Immigration regulations.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnir Chatterji\nEMEA Immigration Partner\n\nRekha Simpson\nDirector, Middle East Immigration\n\nAnanth Prasad\nManager, Middle East Immigration\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alertshttp://www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nContact us on the following address – me-immigration@vialto.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&amp;R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "December 11, 2023",
        "content": "07 December 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nUnited Kingdom | Upcoming immigration changes\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nThe latest updates to the immigration rules have been published by the Home Office. Some of these proposals, including the updates to the visitor rules, have been in the pipeline for a while and were confirmed to be going ahead by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the recent\nNovember 2023 Budget.\n\nWe are also pleased to see the changes to the ‘wet lease’ agreement, which Vialto Partners has been working on with the Home Office. Other updates to the rules include the additional numbers to the Youth Mobility route, changes to the EU Settlement Scheme rules, and the Ancestry Route.\n\nThe Detail\n\nVisitor Rules\n\nUpdates to the Visitor Rules have removed the Permitted Paid Engagement (PPE) Visitor type, with its provisions being moved into the Standard Visa route, enabling all visitors to undertake PPE without requiring a specialist visa for as long as any client facing work is “incidental” to the visitor’s employment abroad, and does not constitute a service or project being offshored to their overseas employer.\n\nSimilarly, all visitors from 31 January 2024 may work remotely whilst in the UK for as long as any work conducted is not the primary reason for their travel to the UK.\nThe Visitor Rules will now also allow flight crew to come to the UK between the months of March and October as part of a Civil Aviation Authority approved wet lease agreement. For impacted businesses this is a very welcome change.Youth Mobility Scheme\n\nThe Statement of Changes published by the Home Office on 07 December 2023 has expanded the Youth Mobility Scheme to include citizens of Uruguay as well as significantly increasing the number of allocated places for citizens of Japan and the Republic of Korea.\n\nThe number of nationals that may be admitted to the Youth Mobility Scheme from Japan will increase from one and a half thousand to six thousand, and the number of nationals eligible for admission from the Republic of Korea will increase from one thousand to five thousand.\n\nFurther, the age range of nationals from the Republic of Korea, Australia and Canada has been expanded from 18-30 to 18-35, and Japanese and Republic of Korean nationals will no longer be required to obtain an invitation in order to apply for the scheme.\n\nOther considerations\n\n● EU Settlement Scheme status holders will be subject to further scrutiny and could be refused entry into the UK if ‘they fail to satisfy the decision maker that their leave has not lapsed, and they do not have entry clearance granted under Appendix Returning Resident.’\n● Ancestry Visa holders must be in the UK to apply for an extension to their application. Moreover, these visa holders will also need to satisfy all validity requirements for both main applicants and dependents, including for settlement applications.\n\nRecommended action\n\nThe modification to the visitor route will allow for some flexibility to carry out work in the UK as long as there is no clear evidence that the work being done is primary. This change will put businesses at greater risk of non-compliance with business visitor and permitted activities rules if robust controls that monitor individuals visiting the UK are not put in place.\n\nWhere there is clear cross-over from ‘working’ to ‘visiting’, firms should consider utilising non- visit routes such as the Global Business Mobility visa route. Where longer, more localised, provision is required, employers have many options to consider and should certainly review the Skilled Worker route. These routes allow for full compliance with the immigration rules and would give employers the peace of mind required while their employees remain in the UK delivering on projects.\n\nFor more information on how to establish greater controls, and implement automated measures, into your visitor programmer, please reach out to our Business Traveler team for more information at https://vialtopartners.com/solutions/business-travel.\n\nHow we can help\n\nVialto can provide expert advice in navigating the positive changes that the expansion and changes to the Visitor visa and means for employees, as well as provide assistance in bringing talent in with the Youth Mobility Scheme.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nLyudmyla Davies\nlyudmyla.davies@vialtopartners.com\n\nIan Robinson\nian.j.robinson@vialtopartners.com\n\nLucy Vaux\nlucinda.vaux@vialtopartners.com\n\nAwale Olad\nawale.olad@vialtopartners.com\n\nKelly Terrington\nkelly.terrington@vialtopartners.com\n\nMaggie Liang\nxuxian.liang@vialtopartners.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com",

        "date": "February 23, 2023",
        "content": "21 February 2023\n\nHMRC has announced that there will be changes for all Employment-Related Securities (ERS) returns submitted after 5 April 2023 both for non tax-favoured arrangements (formerly Form 42) and for tax-favoured arrangements :\n\n● It will be mandatory for the employing company PAYE reference to be reported on the form\n\n● The operation of PAYE also needs to be confirmed\n\n● The National Insurance number field for each employee will be compulsory.\n\nHMRC’s Employment Related Securities Bulletin 47 states that if an employee does not have an NI number, the following format must be used to generate a 9 character reference (2 letters, 6 numbers and a letter) to be used only in the annual return template:\n\n1. “TN”, to indicate an ERS reference that cannot be used for any other purpose;\n\n2. The employee’s date of birth in format DDMMYY; and\n\n3. the “no NI number reason identifier” (X, Y or Z): X means the employee is under 16 years old,\n\nY means the employee has applied for, but not yet received, an NI number and Z means the employee has never paid NICs, because they have never been liable for them (for instance because of continuing social security coverage in another country). HMRC is yet to publish its revised template and guidance notes. We expect these to be made available by the end of February / early March.\n\nREMEMBER – Thursday 6th July 2023 is the deadline for filing your 2022/23 ERS Forms\n\nHow Does This Impact Us?\n\nThe changes announced by HMRC do not on the face of it seem like big changes, simply changing a few fields from optional to mandatory, however for a company undertaking the data gathering process, this will be a big lift. You will now have to ensure that\n\n1. Payroll provides the PAYE reference for each individual on the ERS returns\n\n2. Payroll is able to provide confirmation of whether or not they reported the income and remitted PAYE to HMRC\n\n3. Payroll provides the NI number for each individual\n\n4. For anyone who does not have an NI number, you will need to ensure payroll provides why they do not have an NI number and you will also need to ensure you are able to gather their date of birth to include.\n\nHistorically companies have found the data gathering for the ERS forms onerous and therefore did skip on fields, such as the above, because of this, especially where there was no communication with the UK payroll departments during the process. We would recommend that with these new requirements, companies start to consider their data gathering requirements sooner rather than later.\n\nHow Can Vialto Partners Help?\n\nVialto Partners has a dedicated team and tools to help you with the preparation of your ERS returns for 2022/23 (and earlier years)\n\n● Need help in how to register your plan (or deregister schemes)? Our team knows the HMRC portal extremely well and can walk you through or provide you with a guidance document.\n\n● Incomplete data could result in your returns being rejected on submission – we can help with a format review to make sure your return will get accepted first time.\n\n● Want help in the data you need to gather this year? We can provide you with a template to help you ensure you gather all the relevant information.\n\n● We can complete your returns entirely for you, or we are more than happy to answer questions, walk you through the HMRC systems or review returns you have prepared yourself.

        "content": "06 February 2023\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nGovernor Kathy Hochul’s 2024 executive budget was introduced on February 1, 2023. Among the proposed changes, the transportation budget bill proposes to increase the top rate of the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax (MCTMT).\n\nThe Detail\n\nThe MCTMT is a tax imposed on certain employers and self-employed individuals engaging in business within the metropolitan commuter transportation district (MCTD). This department administers the tax for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The MCTD includes the counties of New York (Manhattan), Bronx, Kings (Brooklyn), Queens, Richmond (Staten Island), Rockland, Nassau, Suffolk, Orange, Putnam, Dutchess, and Westchester. An employer is subject to the MCTMT if they are required to withhold New York State income tax from wages and their payroll expense exceeds $312,500 in any calendar quarter.\n\nCurrently, the MCTMT applies to an employer’s payroll expense for covered employees for each calendar quarter multiplied by the applicable MCTMT rate as shown in the table below:\n\n\n\nThe proposed executive budget would increase the highest rate of 0.34% to 0.5%. The increase in rate is expected to generate over $800 million in annual increased funding for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).\n\nHow we can help\n\nThe MCTMT is currently reviewed on NYS Withholding and MCTMT payroll audits, and we’ve seen employers pay large assessments due to improper employee tax setup or not taxing deferred compensation when employees relocate out of NYS and the MCTD.

        "content": "The Canadian government recently implemented several changes to the Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) Program Workforce Solutions Road Map, as well as some amendments to the eligibility criteria for international students who wish to apply for a post-graduate work permit. The government has also launched the new Innovation Stream for high-skilled occupations. Additionally, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs announced important updates coming to the British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program (BC PNP) that will take effect in January 2025.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the Honourable Randy Boissonnault, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages, announced the following important changes to the TFW Program Workforce Solutions Road Map, which will take effect on May 1, 2024:\n\nAdditionally, as of January 1st, 2024, employers are required to review the wages of TFWs annually to ensure fairness and to verify that they are paying TFWs the median wage throughout their employment period.\n\nOn January 22, 2024, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) confirmed that international graduates of programs that were delivered pursuant to a public-private curriculum licensing arrangement will no longer be eligible for a post-graduation work permit (PGWP). These changes – which were previously expected to take place on September 1, 2024 – will now take effect on May 15, 2024. Consequently, international students who undertake this type of program on May 15, 2024 or later will not be eligible for a PGWP upon graduation.\n\nIn June 2023, the Government of Canada announced the planned launch of a new Innovation Stream under the International Mobility Program, which was expected to go live by the end of 2023. Government indicated that this new stream would provide high-skilled workers with multi-year work permits to take up employment with companies identified as contributing to Canada’s innovation goals.\n\nIRCC recently provided clarification regarding the eligibility for this program. At present, participation in the Innovation Stream will be limited to 8 Canadian companies with high growth potential who have been selected to participate in Innovation Canada’s Global Hypergrowth Program. The Global Hypergrowth Program is a new scale-up program aimed at providing support to promising companies, with a view to innovating and expanding in Canada and internationally. To be eligible for a work permit under the Innovation Stream, applicants will need a job offer from a participant in the Global Hypergrowth Program in a high-skilled occupation, e.g.., TEER categories 0, 1, 2, or 3,. Applicants will also be required to demonstrate that they have the necessary education and experience for the position in line with the TEER requirements for the said position.\n\nBC’s Ministry of Municipal Affairs announced that they will be updating the BCPNP’s selection criteria, with the updates coming into effect in January 2025. The BC PNP will share more details in late 2024.\n\nThe updates will be focusing on the current International Graduate and International Post-Graduate streams and the language requirements.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nNadine Landry\nPartner\n\nMelodie Molina\nPartner\n\nSusan Martyn\nPartner\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nContact us at the following address: me-immigration@vialto.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

De plus, le ministère des Affaires municipales a annoncé d’importantes mises à jour à venir au Programme des candidats de la province de la Colombie-Britannique qui entreront en vigueur en janvier 2025.\n\nLe 21 mars 2024, l’honorable Randy Boissonnault, ministre de l’Emploi, du Développement de la main-d’œuvre et des Langues officielles, a annoncé les changements importants suivants au Plan d’action pour les employeurs et la main-d’œuvre du PTET, qui entreront en vigueur le 1er mai 2024:\n\nDe plus, depuis le 1er janvier 2024, les employeurs sont tenus de réviser annuellement le salaire des TET pour garantir l’équité et s’assurer qu’ils leur versent le taux salarial en vigueur tout au long de leur période d’emploi.\n\nLe 22 janvier 2024, Immigration, Réfugiés et Citoyenneté Canada (IRCC) a confirmé que les diplômés étrangers des programmes dispensés dans le cadre d’un accord public-privé d’utilisation de programme d’études ne seraient plus admissibles à un permis de travail post-diplôme. Ces changements qui devaient prendre effet le 1er septembre 2024 entreront désormais en vigueur le 15 mai 2024. Par conséquent, les diplômés étrangers qui suivront ce type de programme le 15 mai 2024 ou plus tard ne seront plus admissibles à un permis de travail post-diplôme après l’obtention de leur diplôme.\n\nEn juin 2023, le gouvernement du Canada avait annoncé le lancement prévu d’un nouveau volet d’innovation dans le cadre du Programme de mobilité internationale qui devrait être mis en ligne vers la fin de 2023. Le gouvernement a indiqué que ce nouveau volet offrirait aux travailleurs hautement qualifiés des permis de travail de plusieurs années leur permettant d’occuper un emploi auprès d’entreprises identifiées comme contribuant aux objectifs d’innovation du Canada.\n\nIRCC a récemment fourni des éclaircissements concernant l’admissibilité à ce programme. À l’heure actuelle, la participation au volet d’innovation est limitée à 8 entreprises canadiennes à fort potentiel de croissance qui ont été sélectionnées pour participer au Projet pour l’hypercroissance mondiale du Canada. Il s’agit d’un nouveau programme de mise à l’échelle visant à soutenir des entreprises prometteuses dans une perspective d’innovation et d’expansion au Canada et à l’international. Pour être admissibles à un permis de travail dans le cadre du volet d’innovation, les candidats auront besoin d’une offre d’emploi provenant d’un participant au Projet pour l’hypercroissance mondial dans une profession hautement qualifiée, par exemple, appartenant aux catégories TEER 0, 1, 2 ou 3. Les candidats devront également démontrer qu’ils possèdent la formation et l’expérience nécessaires pour le poste, conformément aux exigences du TEER pour ledit poste.\n\nLe ministère des Affaires municipales de la Colombie-Britannique a annoncé qu’il mettrait à jour les critères de sélection du programme des candidats de la Colombie-Britannique. Ces mises à jour entreront en vigueur en janvier 2025. Le programme des candidats de la Colombie-Britannique partagera plus de détails à la fin de 2024.\n\nLes mises à jour porteront sur les volets actuels des diplômés étrangers et des diplômés post-universitaires étrangers, ainsi que sur les exigences linguistiques.\n\nPour plus d’informations sur ce qui précède, veuillez contacter un membre de notre équipe chez Vialto Associés, ou alternativement:\n\nNadine Landry\nAssociée\n\nMelodie Molina\nAssociée\n\nSusan Martyn\nAssociée\n\nDe plus amples informations sur Vialto Partners sont disponibles ici: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners et/ou Vialto Associés (« Vialto ») fait référence aux filiales détenues en propriété exclusive de CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited ainsi qu’aux autres membres du réseau mondial Vialto Partners.

        "title": "Kenya | Employment Tax | Affordable Housing Levy (AHL)",
        "date": "October 4, 2023",
        "content": "October 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact High\n\nSummary\n\nThe Kenyan Affordable Housing Levy (AHL) is a mandatory levy first introduced via Finance Bill 2023. This is a levy designed and intended to help the government of Kenya build affordable houses for the venerable in society. The levy’s initial proposal was a 3% combined contribution by both employee and employer (capped at KES 5,000 per month). However, this was later amended by the Finance Act, 2023 (the Act) and assented by the president bringing with it a raft of changes to include:\n\n• The employee contribution was fixed at 1.5% on the employee’s monthly gross earnings.\n• The Act required that the employer matches up 1.5% of the employee’s contribution.\n• The KES 5,000 capping was dropped.\n\nIn its nature the Finance Act, 2023 effective 1 July 2023 had some contentious clauses forcing stakeholders to seek the courts injunction in the implementation. While court’s pronouncement itself on this matter, it only delayed implementation while the effective date remained as 1st July 2023. The government sought for the lifting of the suspension and the Court of Appeal lifted the suspension conservatory orders on 28 July 2023.\n\nThe Detail\n\nThis Act introducing the AHL amended the Kenya Employment Act, 2007 by introducing a new Section 31B. Though currently the implementation is being carried by the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) any recourse on the AHL will be via the Employment Act and not tax legislation. Considering the above, the KRA under the Public Notice dated 3rd August 2023 was officially appointed to be the collecting Agent of the AHL.\n\nSection 31C of the Employment Act provides that all employers are obligated under this Act to collect and remit the levy together with other statutory deductions to the KRA by the 9th of the month following the payroll month. Section 31C(2) imposes a 2% monthly penalty on the amount due until the levy is paid up.\n\nThe KRA through a public notice has provided guidelines and clarifications on some of the unclear terms e.g., what will constitute “gross salary”. They have termed “gross salary” to include base salary and all regularly (determined intervals- quarterly/half yearly) paid cash allowances. However, they have exempted one off payment including leave allowance, bonus, gratuity, pension, severance pay or any other terminal dues and benefits.\n\nIt is interesting that individual taxpayers who should ordinarily qualify for a relief under Section 30A of the Income Tax Act Cap. 470 are not eligible to such relief under the new Section 31B of the Employment Act.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe introduction of AHL has brought significant changes to payroll tax compliance requirements including a reduction on employee take home pay.\n\nThe housing levy is an irrevocable fund, and neither is it transferrable nor cannot be cashed.\n\nThe individual’s eligibility for this housing program are those Kenyans with a monthly income of below KES 150,000, this therefore discriminates against those contributing more to the fund.\n\nWhilst the Court of Appeal lifted the conservatory orders suspending the implementation of the Finance Act 2023, to enable the government access funding, there is still a substantive case in court challenging the constitutionality of the Finance Act, 2023. This case will continue at the High Court until a final determination is reached.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n• Andrew Ondieki, Director | andrew.ondieki@vialtopartners.com\n• Kennedy Kyalo, Senior Manager | kennedy.kyalo@vialtopartners.com\n• Boaz Okeyo, Manager | boaz.okeyo@vialtopartners.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Germany | Employment Tax | Non-resident directors working in Germany",
        "date": "April 23, 2024",
        "content": "Even after the end of the Covid pandemic, many employees continue to work from home, utilize remote work offers from their employer and work (temporarily) from abroad for Germany. Tasks are often distributed globally and employees from one country take on tasks for another country. In addition to the tax challenges posed by matrix organizations, the global activities of managing directors also pose a tax challenge.\n\nManaging directors who work for a German company but are not resident in Germany are considered to have limited tax liability. Persons with limited tax liability are only subject to tax in Germany on income from German sources. This includes, for example, income from German working days or, however also in total the income from employment of a managing director or a person who has power of attorney for the German company. In a first step, this income is therefore subject to limited tax liability in Germany.\n\nIn a further step, the relevant DTA must then be examined. As a rule, the home country as the country of residence has the right of taxation. Deviating from this, the German days can be taxed in Germany as the country of employment if:\n\nIf the German company is economically responsible for the wages for the work performed for it, the assignment\nof the employee to the host company is in the interest of the host company, the employee is integrated into the work process of the host company and is subject to its instructions and the director or person with proxy does not provide a pure management service, the economic employer is generally to be affirmed under German tax law. In case of doubt the case needs toe measured against the decision of the German Federal Tax Court dated November 4, 2021.\n\nIn the case that German days are taxable in Germany via the German payroll then from 2023 onwards, the daily wage tax table must also be applied.  However, it should be noted that there are also special regulations on the taxation of managing directors in a large number of double taxation agreements with Germany.\n\nThus, cross-border managing director activities are very prone to errors and must therefore be examined in detail from a tax perspective at both employee and employer level. We recommend a check before appointing a person for such a position in Germany and are happy to answer any questions.\n\nAuch nach Ende der Corona-Pandemie arbeiten viele Mitarbeiter weiterhin aus dem Homeoffice, nutzen Remote-Work-Angebote des Arbeitgebers und sind (zeitweise) aus dem Ausland für Deutschland tätig. Oftmals werden Aufgaben global verteilt und Mitarbeiter aus einem Staat übernehmen Aufgaben für einen anderen Staat. Neben den steuerlichen Herausforderungen durch Matrix-Organisationen stellt inzwischen auch die globale Tätigkeit von Geschäftsführern eine steuerliche Herausforderung dar.\n\nGeschäftsführer, die für eine deutsche Gesellschaft arbeiten, aber in Deutschland keinen Wohnsitz haben, gelten als beschränkt steuerpflichtig. Beschränkt steuerpflichtige Personen unterliegen nur mit Einkünften aus deutschen Quellen der Steuerpflicht in Deutschland. Als solche gelten zum Beispiel Einkünfte aus deutschen Arbeitstagen, aber eben auch in Gänze Einkünfte aus nichtselbständiger Tätigkeit eines Geschäftsführers oder einer Person, die für die deutsche Gesellschaft Prokura besitzt. Somit unterliegen diese Einkünfte in einem ersten Schritt der beschränkten Steuerpflicht in Deutschland.\n\nIn einem weiteren Schritt muss danach das zugehörige DBA geprüft werden. In der Regel hat das Heimatland als Ansässigkeitsstaat das Besteuerungsrecht. Abweichend davon, können die deutschen Tage in Deutschland als Tätigkeitsstaat besteuert werden, wenn:\n\nWenn das deutsche Unternehmen den Arbeitslohn für die ihm geleistete Arbeit wirtschaftlich trägt, der Einsatz des Arbeitnehmers bei dem aufnehmenden Unternehmen in dessen Interesse erfolgt, der Arbeitnehmer in den Arbeitsablauf des aufnehmenden Unternehmens eingebunden und dessen Weisungen unterworfen ist und der Geschäftsführer bzw. die Person mit Handlungsvollmacht nicht eine reine Dienstleistung erbringt, ist nach deutschem Steuerrecht der wirtschaftliche Arbeitgeber regelmäßig zu bejahen. Im Zweifel ist die Rechtsprechung des Bundesfinanzhofs vom 04.11.2021 zur Prüfung heranzuziehen.\n\nIst eine tageweise Versteuerung über die deutsche Gehaltsabrechnung vorzunehmen, so ist seit dem Jahr 2023 hierbei auch die Tagestabelle anzuwenden.\n\nZu beachten ist jedoch, dass es in einer Vielzahl von Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen mit Deutschland Sonderregelungen zur Besteuerung von Geschäftsführern gibt.\n\nDie grenzüberschreitende Geschäftsführertätigkeit ist somit sehr fehleranfällig und daher im Detail aus steuerlicher Sicht sowohl auf Arbeitnehmer- also auch auf Arbeitgeberebene zu prüfen. Wir empfehlen eine Prüfung vor Besetzung der Funktion in Deutschland und stehen bei Fragen gerne zur Verfügung.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMathias Schmitt \nPartner\n\nDamaris Besenreuther\nSenior Manager\n\nSina Kunzweiler\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit: www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "United Kingdom | Immigration | UK Government announces a series of reviews into UK immigration policy",
        "date": "August 1, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nUnited Kingdom | UK Government announces a series of reviews into UK immigration policy\n\nSummary\n\nThe new UK Government has announced a series of reviews into UK immigration policy and has recommitted to a policy to reduce net migration into the UK.\n\nThe independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) has been asked to report on:\n\nThe MAC will be strengthened with more staff and resources to complete its work.\n\nThe MAC is expected to deliver its report into family migration within the next 6-9 months and its wider report into business migration within 12 months.\n\nDuring this time, the UK Government will maintain the salary thresholds introduced by the previous government.\n\nThe Detail\n\nThe new Labour Government’s first act on immigration has set out the broader trajectory of immigration policy in years to come. In a written statement to Parliament, the new Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said that ‘immigration must not be used as an alternative to tackling skills shortages and labour market failures here in the UK’.\n\nThe statement is in keeping with the Labour Party’s long term view that increasing net migration and a reliance on overseas workers is linked to inadequate domestic development of skills.\n\nThe statement blames the previous Conservative Government for the ‘failure over many years to tackle skills shortages and other problems in the UK labour market’, resulting in businesses having to rely on migrant workers to address gaps in their workforce. Net migration continues to also be a central issue that needs to be pressured down but will require a ‘different approach’.\n\nTransfer of policies\n\nYvette Cooper’s statement confirmed that many of the previous Government’s recent policies will be kept for the time being, including:\n\nThe Government will also progress the recommendations around the Graduate visa route, including cracking down on agents, collecting and monitoring data around impacts and trends of this route, and degree confirmations.\n\nMigration Advisory Committee to be strengthened\n\nMs Cooper’s statement confirms the intent to strengthen the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) – the arms-length migration and labour market Government advisory body – by increasing its resource and capacity with Home Office staff while maintaining  its independence.\n\nThe MAC will now be tasked with ‘forecasting future trends, alongside continuing to review and provide independent, evidence-based recommendations on key areas of the immigration system’. Its first commission under the new Home Secretary will be to:\n\nReview the reliance of key sectors on international recruitment [in particular] to look at IT and engineering – occupations which have consistently, over a decade or more, been included on shortage occupation lists and relied on significant levels of international recruitment. The percentage of the workforce in these occupational groups made up by new foreign workers issued visas, are in the top 10 for all occupational groups in the UK.\n\nSignificant research has already been undertaken on these sectors and the conclusion to date is that businesses are unable to meet labour demand solely by reliance on the domestic workforce. Where the MAC’s report can make an impact is whether it recommends stricter conditions on visas in these sectors, which would be against the grain of current mainstream thinking. The Government’s focus on ‘reliance’ indicates that there will be greater focus on employers’ habits rather than a lacking labour market.\n\nSpouse and dependant visa salary threshold to be reviewed\n\nThe Home Secretary  has announced a MAC review of the spousal and dependant visa category financial requirements which was recently increased to£29,000 with a further increase planned for 2025. The threshold will remain in place until the MAC submits its findings to the Home Office.\n\nRecommendations\n\nEmployers will certainly need to keep a lookout for the MAC’s report and the recommendations that will likely focus on business shortcomings in skilling up the local labour market. Moreover, while engaging with the MAC’s commission will be critical, the new Skills England body, which is expected to work closely with the MAC, will be the driver of the new Government’s number one priority and mission, ‘kickstarting the economy’. Skills England will have a substantial influence on where immigration policy, in particular, work-related routes of migration go in the future, which will also likely be influenced by the leadership in the Department for Education and the Prime Minister’s office.\n\nHow we can help\n\nContact your Vialto Partners contact, or one of us in the information below if you have any queries about the content in this newsletter, or would like to discuss any other business immigration and mobility issues.\n\nContact us\n\nLyudmyla Davies\nPartner\n\nIan Robinson\nPartner\n\nAndrea Als\nDirector\n\nTom Marsom\nDirector\n\nAwale Olad\nSenior Manager\n\nLucy Vaux\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nSummary\n\nThere has been a significant increase in the level of scrutiny of payroll tax obligations for employers from Australia’s state revenue authorities. Real time reporting through single touch payroll and data sharing with other authorities such as the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and state workcover authorities, has enabled better targeting of non-compliance with payroll tax obligations.\n\nThe detail\n\nBy way of background, payroll tax is a state-based tax imposed on employers in respect of taxable wages. Payroll tax is based on “self-assessment”, which requires employers to establish whether the level of their wages paid or payable requires them to register. Each Australian state and territory has their own payroll tax threshold and once the wages paid by an employer to their ‘employees’ exceeds a threshold for the tax year, payroll tax becomes payable to the relevant State Revenue Office (SRO).\n\nBased on our experience, the state revenue authorities perform a certain level of data matching and analytics against other employer lodgements made to the ATO as part of their internal reviews in determining areas to review or audit in payroll tax. This can result in audits based on specific issues identified through this analysis (such as taxable wages for fringe benefits, contractors or employer share schemes) or a general investigation review. In relation to cases where specific issues have been identified through data matching and analytics, the payroll tax authorities have generally then extended their review to cover not just that specific issue but the entire payroll tax annual reconciliation, for a 5 year period. This increase in audit and investigation activity has been felt across many state and territory jurisdictions, with Victoria and New South Wales leading the way.\n\nIn our experience, the marked increase in investigation activity from the SRO’s have been in respect of the following aspects and their inclusion in payroll tax returns:\n\nWhat this means for employers\n\nIt is evident that payroll tax compliance is a key focus for the respective SRO. The increased availability of data has allowed the SRO to better identify non compliant employers. It is therefore more important than ever that organisations ensure that compliance and governance processes are up to date in relation to the completion of the annual payroll tax reconciliation, including:\n\nHow we can help\n\nTo help you understand your risk profile, Vialto’s payroll tax health check process is an informative method of gaining valuable insights and to assist with limiting the potential exposure of non compliance.\n\nShould you wish to understand more about the recent audits and investigations and your organisation’s risk level or if you are currently undergoing a tax authority payroll tax review or audit, our Vialto Employment Taxes team has significant experience in this area to support you through the process.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMaria Ravese\nPartner\n\nKristy Whitnell\nDirector\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Netherlands | Immigration | Migration Advisory Council publishes report on labour migration",
        "date": "December 13, 2023",
        "content": "13 December 2023\n\nNetherlands | Immigration | Migration Advisory Council publishes report on labour migration\n\nImpact: Medium\n\nSummary  \nOn 11 December 2023, the Dutch Migration Advisory Council (Adviesraad Migratie) published a report on labour migration in the Netherlands. In essence, the report  concludes that labour migration will make a positive demographic and social contribution  in the long term, especially if focused on highly-skilled and certain essential mid- to low skilled sectors.\n\nThe Detail\nThe Dutch Migration Advisory Council is an independent government body that advises the Dutch  government and parliament on migration law and policy. Their latest report, published this week,  explores the contribution labour migration can make to alleviate future demographic challenges  in the Netherlands. For this purpose, the long-term effect of increased labour migration on the  demographic was compared with other measures, such as further raising the pensionable age  and higher labour force participation.\n\nThe main issues assessed in the report are the ageing workforce, structural workforce shortages and the preservation of welfare.\n\nBasing its analysis on the assumption that the nature of the labour migration is temporary, the report concludes that labour migration cannot be the sole solution to the demographic and economic challenges posed by an ageing population, but it can make a useful contribution by mitigating them. According to the report, selective labour migration can especially help mitigate the impact of an ageing workforce, referred to in the report as ‘grey pressure’, and reduce specific labour shortages, mostly in the 2030-2040 period\n\nThe ‘grey pressure’\nThe concept of ‘grey pressure’ measures the strain on the welfare state that an ageing population has. The report explored the extent to which an annual influx of 50,000 migrants could alleviate ‘grey pressure’ and concluded that such an influx could play a mitigating role similar to a gradual increase in the retirement age. However, even in that case, the ‘grey pressure’ in 2040 would be about 8% higher than it is now and 6-7% higher in 2070. To stabilize the growing ‘grey pressure’, an annual influx of over 150,000 labour migrants until 2030 and an annual influx of over 180,000 labour migrants between 2030 and 2040 would be needed, according to the Migration Advisory Council.\n\nWorkforce shortages\nThe report suggests that an annual influx of 50,000 labour migrants in the Netherlands could significantly contribute to the potential workforce, reducing the risk of structural personnel shortages until 2040. After 2040, the potential workforce is expected to grow without additional labour migration. However, it notes that the effect of an annual influx of 50,000 labour migrants would be three times greater than the gradual increase in the retirement age. Similarly, the effect of the influx of the 50,000 labour migrants would also be comparable to an annual extension of the average working hours by 10 minutes; leading to an average of almost three working hours per week longer by 2040 compared to today.\n\nAdditionally, next to the overall workforce shortage, the report highlights that unattractive work conditions and a lack of qualified workers are two other leading causes of the workforce shortage. The discussion touches on how attracting labour migrants may temporarily alleviate these shortages but could hinder efforts to improve the quality of work conditions.\n\nPreservation of welfare\nFinally, the report confirms that labour migrants contribute to population growth, which leads to a positive result in the overall level of prosperity. According to the report, the phase of life when labour migrants relocate to the Netherlands does not have a significant impact on the level of prosperity. What the report also stipulates is that the level of prosperity is connected to the type of work that labour migrants are fulfilling in the Dutch labour market. More specifically, the average level of prosperity will increase if labour migrants fill certain sectors where there is a significant shortage by doing highly specialised work (e.g. the IT sector). The opposite is the case when labour migrants are fulfilling low-productivity work (e.g. couriers), where the average level of prosperity would decrease, according to the report.\n\nSkills levels\nIt is worth noting that when referring to labour migrants, the report refers both to highly-skilled (and highly educated) as well as low- to mid-skilled labour migrants.\n\nNevertheless, the report concludes that the impact on overall prosperity and state welfare levels mainly depends on productivity, with only the highly productive labour migrants, in whichever group, possibly leading to an increase in the state welfare levels.\n\nHowever the report also states that low-skilled labour migration, in particular, can have complex demographic effects in the long-term, as it would affect the existing low-skilled labour market and ultimately have a negative (social) effect on the low-skilled migrants themselves. Reasons for this would be continuing low wages and unfavourable working conditions, which are considerations that generally do not apply to highly-skilled migration.\n\nConclusion of the report \nThe report confirms that labour migration across all skills levels can be a key contributing factor in tackling the demographic challenges in the Netherlands in the decades to come. One of the more effective ways to do this, according to the report, is to ensure labour migrants fill gaps in the labour market that are not filled by the local workforce. In this respect the report suggests to focus more on highly-skilled migration and mid- to low-skilled migration only in certain sectors where there are gaps in the local labour market (e.g. manufacturing, healthcare, IT).\n\nHowever the Migration Advisory Council has also concluded that labour migration cannot be the only solution, with other measures, such as increasing productivity and the pensionable age, as possible alternative or complementary measures to tackle demographic challenges.\n\nWhat this means for employers \nThe publication of this report comes shortly after the Dutch General Election, where Geert Wilders’ PVV emerged as the largest party, which is reported to be looking to tighten immigration by reintroducing work permits for all labour migrants. See our Dutch Election Update for more details in this regard.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the findings of the report will affect the current political discussions around the formation of a government. Rather than advising a particular policy direction, the report has assessed the impact labour migration could have in light of demographic challenges in the future. With asylum and labour migration being key topics in the lead-up to the election, it is possible that this report’s findings will be used as a basis for government policy in future.\n\nContact us\nVialto will continue to monitor developments and the possible impact for businesses and employees.

        "title": "Luxembourg | Employment Tax | Amendment to the Double Tax Treaty (DTT) between Luxembourg and Germany—applicable as of 1 January 2024",
        "date": "April 24, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nAmendment to the Double Tax Treaty (DTT) between Luxembourg and Germany—applicable as of 1 January 2024\n\nSummary\n\nOn 18 March 2024 the Luxembourg tax authorities issued a circular 1 providing details of its interpretation of the Protocol modifying the Double Tax Treaty (“DTT”) between Luxembourg and Germany. The principal impact of the  Protocol relates to the “tolerance threshold” applicable to German cross border employees, whereby the threshold is increased from 19 to 34 days as from 1 January 2024. Another amendment relates to the “subject to tax” clause within the DTT where a detailed interpretation of the same has been provided. Finally, the way in which income related to exemptions from work and leaving indemnities should be sourced has been modified. Please find below the highlights.\n\n1 Circulaire du directeur des contributions L.G. – Conv. D.I. no71 du 18 mars 2024\n\nThe detail\n\nLegal background :\n\na Protocol was signed between the 2 countries on 6 July 2023 modifying the previous DTT. Both countries concluded a Mutual Agreement on 11 January 2024 providing details on the application/interpretation of the amended DTT. The director of the Luxembourg authorities issued a circular on 18 March 2024 outlining their view on the pragmatic application of some aspects of the modified DTT.\n\nIncrease of the tolerance threshold :\n\nThe biggest (and most welcome) change arising from the Protocol is the increase of the tolerance threshold for German cross-border workers from 19 to 34 days – meaning that a German tax resident working for a Luxembourg employer is fully taxable in Luxembourg provided that she/he works less than 35 days out of Luxembourg in a calendar year. This puts the German cross-border worker on an equal footing with the Belgian and French cross borders workers as from 1 January 2024.\n\nAdditional details on the application of this threshold were provided.\n\nCounting of the days:\n\nThe Mutual Agreement specifies that a 30 minute tolerance threshold is applicable. Therefore, if a German cross border employee works less than 30 minutes in a country outside of Luxembourg – (e.g. an employe reading her/his emails before commuting to Luxembourg) – this would not be counted towards the 34 day threshold. As such, if the employee works 30 minutes or more outside of Luxembourg, then a full day is considered when considering if the employee has reached the threshold.\n\nThe 34 day threshold is assessed on a calendar year basis without any prorate applying for part-time work or commuting activities exercised for only a part of the year (e.g. a German resident employee beginning a Luxembourg employment on 1 August).\n\nDays where an employee is on sick leave should no longer be considered as working time (previously allocated to the country of employment), and should now be removed from the counting of the total workdays.\n\nAllocation of the right to tax between the 2 countries:\nIf the employee exceeds the 34 days based on the above rules, the right to tax the salary is shared between the countries based on the effective time worked, which it to be broken down into minutes.\n\nExample\n\nTo illustrate the above rules, we assume the situation of a German tax resident who works from home for 60 minutes (1 hour) every day and then commutes to the office in Luxembourg where they work 420 minutes (7 hours. The employee earns EUR 80,000 (base salary) per year. In this example, the employee is deemed to have worked every day from Germany and therefore exceeds the 34 day limit. The taxation of the employment income is therefore allocated between Germany and Luxembourg.\nGermany will have the right to tax 10k EUR (80K EUR x 60/480 minutes) and Luxembourg the remainder (i.e. 70K EUR).\n\nLeaving indemnity:\nThe rules on the leaving indemnities / severance have been modified. The allocation of the right to tax leaving indemnities between the 2 countries is done by reference to the working time spent by the employee in the preceding 5 years. Specific allocation rules apply for indemnities paid under collective redundancy or in connection with the payment of “garden leave”.\n\nAvoidance of double taxation – “subject to tax” provision:\nThe technical “subject to tax” provision has been amended and clarifications have been provided on its interpretation. In a nutshell, if a country (e.g. Luxembourg) has the right to tax income but due to the domestic legislation, does not in fact tax the income as a result of the application of lump sum deductions, tax exemptions, or losses that are carried forward, such income should nonetheless be considered as ‘effectively taxed’ in the country. This approach should avoid taxation in the other country (e.g. Germany). The Mutual Agreement does however clarify that payments which are fully tax exempted in one country, would fall to be taxable in the other country, due to the application of the ‘subject to tax’ clause. We understand that there are ongoing discussions with the Luxembourg authorities on this subject, and therefore there may be further updates / amendments / clarifications.\n\nOn-call payments:\n\nSpecific rules have also been detailed for on-call /’primes d’astreinte’ payments. Irrespective of whether an employee works during the on-call period, it is still considered as working time. On-call payments are taxable in the country where the employee is physically located while they are considered as being on-call.\n\nTaxation of replacement income:\nWith respect to payments paid by the Luxembourg authorities in accordance with the social security legislation\n– CNS, ADEM, CNAP, etc – (e.g. in connection with sickness, maternity leave, unemployment income, parental leave etc.) such payments are no longer categorised as employment income. The taxation of such payments falls under Article 17 of the DTT which addresses the taxation of annuities / pensions. Payments made directly by a such an authority are taxable in that country.\n\nOther\nThe DTT was also amended in respect of other topics. For example, the rules related to the taxation of drivers or civil servants (resident in a country and working partly or fully in the other country) have been amended.\n\nWe expect further clarifications to issue over the coming weeks and months with regards to the application and\ninterpretation of the Mutual Agreement.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nEric Paques\nPartner\n\nDenise Chambers\nDirector\n\nTania Fernandes Morais\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&amp;R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Payroll and Compensation\n\nSummary\n\nAs of January 1, 2025, the Colombian Ministry of Labor increased monthly minimum salary and legal transportation aid for jobs in the private sector. The increase results in a minimum salary around 9.5% higher in comparison to the minimum salary established for 2024.\n\nThe detail\n\nThe monthly minimum gross salary and legal transportation aid has been set as follows. This increase also impacts the minimum integrated salary and social security contribution maximum base:\n\n*Monthly legal transportation aid: It applies to employees earning up to 2 monthly minimum salaries.\n\n** Integrated salary: An integrated salary (salario integral) refers to a compensation package that includes not only the base salary but also various additional components, such as social legal benefits, bonuses, overtime, nighttime, Sundays, and holidays work. Vacation pay is not included in this salary. The minimum integrated salary is 13 times the monthly minimum salary.\n\n*** Maximum base for social security contributions: The calculation base for healthcare, pension and labor risk contributions is capped at 25 times the monthly minimum Colombian salary.\n\nActions\n\nThe minimum salary and legal transportation aid increase is applicable for both national and foreign employees. Thus, as of January 1, 2025, employers are required to raise the minimum ordinary and integrated salary.\n\nFor visa applications submitting after January 1, 2025, the average monthly income for Companies sponsoring visas will increase with the monthly minimum salary.

        "date": "December 10, 2024",
        "content": "Global Mobility Tax\n\nSummary\n\nLast week, the law was finally passed to create a 20% deduction in the regional portion of the Personal Income Tax (IRPF) for non-residents in Spain who establish their fiscal residence in the Community of Madrid and make certain investments (Mbappé Law).\n\nFrom this idea arises the importance of analyzing each case to determine what is more beneficial for the taxpayer: the inpatriate regime or the new investment deduction.\n\nThe detail\n\nLast week, the law was finally passed to create a 20% deduction in the regional portion of the Personal Income Tax for non-residents in Spain who establish their tax residence in the Community of Madrid and make certain investments (Mbappé Law).\n\nAlthough it was approved on November 20 and published on November 28, this regulation will be applicable starting January 1, 2025.\n\nBeyond the goals pursued by the law, such as adherence to the principles of transparency, efficiency, budgetary stability, and financial sustainability, the purpose of this law is to summarize the content of the new deduction, explain its incompatibility with the special regime outlined in Article 93 of the Personal Income Tax Law (Beckham Law), and simplify the choice between both regimes.\n\nRequirement for tax residence: Not having been a tax resident in Spain during the five years prior to the change of residence and maintaining residence until the last fiscal year required for the investment’s permanence (6 years).\n\nContent: Deduction in the regional portion of the Personal Income Tax (IRPF) (Form 100). The deduction in the regional portion, both from the general tax base and the savings tax base, will be 20% of the invested amounts.\n\nInvestments: Assets that generate the right to the deduction. Representative securities of the transfer of own capital to third parties, whether traded or not, in organized markets; that is, public debt and private debt.\n\nSecurities representing participation in the equity of any type of entity, whether traded or not, in organized markets; that is, shares or participations in any entity or investment funds.\n\nInvestments in real estate, entities in tax havens, and entities in which the taxpayer holds, directly or indirectly, more than 40% of the share capital are excluded.\n\nInvestment timing: The investment must be made in the first year of tax residence in the Community of Madrid or the following year, and in the case of investments in Spanish entities, investments made in the year prior to acquiring tax residence in Spain are also accepted.\n\nTiming of the deduction: The deduction can be applied in the year the investment is made, as well as in the following five consecutive years if there is not enough tax liability.\n\nInvestment maintenance: The investment must be held for 6 years, with the possibility of disinvestment and reinvestment within a one-month period.\n\nIt is a deduction, not a special regime. Therefore, the regulation does not require an initial application or any administrative action by the taxpayer.\n\nExample: A resident abroad who establishes his tax residence in Spain, in the Community of Madrid. In their first year, they make an investment of €1,000,000 in shares of a Spanish entity. This generates a deduction of €200,000 to be applied to the regional portion of the tax for that year and the next 5 years in their Personal Income Tax (IRPF) return (Form 100).\n\nArticle 93 of the Personal Income Tax Law (IRPF) regulates the special regime for displaced workers, also known as the inpatriate regime or Law Beckham.\n\nThis law, in effect since 2004, was amended as of January 1, 2023, to reduce the non-residence period to five years and expand the groups eligible for this special regime: employees, managers, digital nomads, researchers, professors, entrepreneurs, family members, etc.\n\nApplying for this special regime means being taxed in a way that, although initially (in 2004) it was like that of a non-resident, today it is a “tertium genus,” a hybrid between taxation under the Personal Income Tax (IRPF) and the Non-Residents Income Tax (IRNR).\n\nThe most notable feature is the option to pay tax on employment income at a flat rate of 24% (for the first €600,000, and 47% for the remainder) during the first 6 years of residence in Spain.\n\nUnder this regime, the only applicable deductions are those for donations, double taxation relief, and the payments made on account of the Non-Residents Income Tax (IRNR) (withholdings and advance payments).\n\nMeaning, the other deductions, whether state or regional, are not applicable.\n\nFrom this idea arises the importance of analyzing each case to determine what is more beneficial for the taxpayer: the inpatriate regime or the new investment deduction.\n\nA comparative analysis of tax savings should weigh the following amounts:\n\nThe incompatibility between these two tax benefits requires an analysis of each case to determine which is more advantageous for the taxpayer, in case they have the option to apply both.\n\nIn cases where only one option is available, the decision will be straightforward. However, if both options are possible, they should be analyzed using the points discussed in this VIALTO INFORMS and considering the taxpayer’s personal and financial circumstances.\n\nThis should be done at the time of relocation. Remember that the deadline to opt for the Beckham Law is 6 months from the start of the activity.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nJosé Mª Leis Mayán \nPartner\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

For this reason, foreign employers without a Swedish PE are only eligible for an R&D reduction comparable to the lower non-PE percentage.\n\nIn order to receive the deduction, certain conditions must be met regarding working hours of your employees and the actual work of research and development. The R&D work needs to be properly documented.\n\nPenalty charges if Specific Information is not filed (Reminder)\n\nFrom 1 January 2021 non-Swedish enterprise without a permanent establishment in Sweden is required to file Specific information to the Swedish Tax Agency in case the foreign entity is:\n\nThe foreign enterprise must provide details on its business activities in Sweden, the time period over which the activities have been carried out, and any other information that the Swedish Tax Agency requires to assess tax liability under the Swedish Income Tax Act.\n\nThe specific information must be submitted on an annual basis and the filing deadline is the same as for the corporate income tax return e.g. for a legal entity with the year end closing date 31 December, the filing deadline is 1 July 2023 if filed on paper, or 1 August 2023 if filed digitally.\n\nIn case the specific information is not filed in a timely manner a late filing fee is SEK 1,250 may be charged. If no income has been filed within three months there can be a second fee, and a third fee after five months.\n\nTax relief for foreign personnel working in Sweden (Update)\n\nForeign citizens carrying out particularly qualified tasks or receiving a monthly remuneration above a certain level may obtain tax relief on their Swedish earned income. Tax relief means that 25 percent of the income is exempt from tax.\n\nIn case Swedish social security contributions are to be paid, the employee exemption will carry equal reduction of employer social security contributions.\n\nIn order to be eligible for tax relief some formal conditions must be met, and the application has to be made within three months after the employee started working in Sweden.\n\nPreviously the expert tax relief could be granted for three years. Since January 1, 2021, the expert tax relief can be applied for five years.\n\nIf tax relief is to be granted on grounds of the employees remuneration, the gross monthly remuneration for work in Sweden needs to exceed twice the price base amount for the calendar year when work started.\n\nThe price base amount for 2023 is SEK 52,500. If work begins in 2023, the monthly remuneration must be at least SEK 105,000.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Croatia | Announced changes of Personal Income Tax Act",
        "date": "January 8, 2025",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nSummary\n\nAs of January 1st, 2025, new amendments of the Personal Income Tax Act have been presented by the Croatian government in the Parliament. Those changes include a further increase of the personal allowance, changes in tax rates and an increase of the threshold for the application of the higher income tax rate.\n\nThe detail\n\nWith the adopted amendments the Croatian government plans on further relieving the tax burden of individuals. Therefore, additional changes have been made regarding the recent changes in tax rates, an increase of the personal allowance and increasing the threshold for applying the higher income tax rates.\n\nFour groups are created based on the size of the local self-government unit and the following minimal and maximal tax rates that can be determined in the decision of each local self-government unit:\n\nWith these changes, each local self-government unit will decide if they will bring any changes to the 2 tax rates that are currently in power. In some cases, i.e. in Zagreb, the tax rates will be lowered by law, for the lower rate from 23,60% to 23% and for the higher rate from 35,40% to 33%.\n\nFurthermore, an increase in the higher tax brackets is adopted. Namely, increase of the amount of the annual tax base on which the higher tax rate will is applied from €50,400 to €60,000 is adopted, that is, the amount of the monthly tax base is increased from €4,200 to €5,000.\n\nThe basic personal allowance is increased from €560 to the amount of €600. Coefficients used in the calculation of the increased personal allowance for dependent children and members of the family and disability are also changed. In accordance with the adopted changes, the amounts of the personal allowance are changed as shown below:\n\nAccording to the adopted amendments, a 100% income tax exemption on wages earned from employment for a period of five years was presented for returnees to Croatia is introduced. The condition for qualifying for this exemption includes having resided abroad for at least two years, with the additional requirement that the person must have previously deregistered permanent residence in Croatia or declared an early departure. This exemption also applies to Croatian citizens who have never registered permanent residence in Croatia.\n\nSince 2014, a regulation has been in effect stipulating that individuals under the age of 30 that are being employed on a permanent basis are exempt from paying salary contributions for a period of 5 years since the day of employment, specifically mandatory health insurance contributions. This measure was intended to encourage the employment of younger workers.\n\nAs of January 1, 2025, this exemption is abolished. However, the provision exempting individuals without prior work experience from paying salary contributions during their first year of employment will remain in place. Additionally, individuals under 30 who are already employed on a permanent basis can utilize this exemption for a full period of 5 years from the date they register in the Croatian insurance system. The abolition of this exemption does not affect workers’ net salaries but will result in a higher payroll cost for employers.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact.\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nAustria | Issuance of Red-White-Red Card Plus to displaced persons from Ukraine\n\nSummary\n\nThe Red-White-Red Card Plus will shortly become available for displaced persons from Ukraine, who have already worked in Austria for at least 12 months in the last 24 months.\n\nThe detail\n\nSince 2022, people who were forced to leave Ukraine due to the armed conflict were granted a temporary right of residence in Austria and were issued an ID card for displaced persons. To work in Austria, these displaced Ukrainians first had to apply for an additional work permit; ultimately this requirement has been waived since April 2023. However, a switch to a different (combined work and residence) permit was not possible.\n\nThe Austrian federal government now announced that a switch to the Red-White-Red Card Plus will be possible for displaced Ukrainians who can prove German language skills and who have already worked in Austria for 12 months in the past 24 months. The Red-White-Red Card Plus is a combined work and residence permit that grants free access to the labor market and offers a long-term perspective for permanent residence. An estimate of 7000 people will benefit from these legal changes.\n\nDisplaced persons who do not (yet) fulfil the requirements for the Red-White-Red Card Plus or do not wish to change to the Red-White-Red Card Plus will continue to have access to the labour market without an additional work permit.\n\nThe necessary legislative amendments have not yet been adopted, but the law is expected to pass at the end of June.\n\nHow we can support\n\n• Advice on the advantages of the Red-White-Red Card Plus\n• Support individuals with applying for the Red-White-Red Card Plus\n• Provide consultation on long-term residence aspects\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nValentina Arnez\nPartner, Attorney at Law (Arnez Rechtsanwalts GmbH*)\n\nAntonia Lehne\nManager, Legal Advisor (Arnez Rechtsanwalts GmbH*)\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\n* Please note that Arnez Rechtsanwalts GmbH is cooperating with the Vialto Partners network and is a member to the Vienna Bar Association, registered as an independent legal entity under Commercial Register No. FN 596972a.\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "China | Immigration | Latest visa exemption policy",
        "date": "July 24, 2024",
        "content": "Recently, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced to extend the visa exemption policy for three more nationalities, which are citizens of Australia, New Zealand and Poland. The policy enables international travel between China and many other countries more convenient. According to the latest statistics, for the first half year of 2024, portion of foreigners entering China with visa exemption has exceed half of the total foreigners’ entry.\n\nFor travelers with ordinary passports, we provide a comprehensive summary for your reference.\n\n\n\nPlease note:\n\nQ: Besides a passport, are there any other materials required for entry?\nA: Firstly, foreign nationals coming to China must comply with the visa exemption policy for purposes such as business, tourism, visiting friends and family, or transiting. We recommend travelers bringing relevant documentation upon entry. For example, travelers on business trips should carry an invitation letter from the Chinese company, flight tickets, and hotel bookings. It is important to reiterate that those coming to China for work, study, or media activities are not included by the visa exemption policy.\n\nQ: Are there any requirements regarding the type and validity of entry documents?\nA: Foreign nationals must hold a valid ordinary passport to enter China, and the passport must be valid for the duration of their stay. For example, if your passport expires on March 1, 2024, you must ensure that you leave China before 24:00 on March 1, 2024. Additionally, it should be noted that the visa exemption policy does not apply to foreign nationals holding travel documents, temporary or emergency passports, or any other documents other than ordinary passports.\n\nQ: How is the visa exemption stay duration calculated?\nA: The visa exemption stay duration is calculated from the date of entry, allowing a continuous stay until 24:00 on the 15th or 30th calendar day.\n\nQ: Can I depart from a country other than my home country?\nA: Foreign nationals eligible for visa exemption entry to China can depart from any country or region outside of China.\n\nQ: Can I extend my visa exemption if it exceeds the period?\nA: Theoretically an extension could be granted, but it is not easily approved. Applicants must provide sufficient reasons for extending their stay in China, along with proof of accommodation， funds for the extended period, and relevant supporting documents. The application must be submitted to the local exit-entry administration bureau where the applicant resides, and the final decision will be made by the local exit-entry administration authorities.\n\nChina’s recent series of visa exemption and transit policy adjustments strengthen regional cooperation and bolster China’s influence on the international and regional stages. For businesses, the simplification of visa procedures means greater convenience for businesspeople conducting short-term visits, meetings, and other activities, thus promoting economic cooperation, trade, and investment. This is a positive signal. However, the implementation of visa exemption policies also raises the risk of illegal employment and residence, necessitating that businesses adopt appropriate management measures to ensure compliance and order.

        "date": "January 30, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nPhilippines | Ease of paying taxes (EOPT) act introduces key administrative tax reforms\n\nSummary\nOn 5 January 2024, the EOPT (Republic Act No. 11976) was signed into law. The EOPT provides important amendments to the Philippine Tax Code, which are geared to safeguard taxpayer rights and welfare, to modernise tax administration with mechanisms that encourage easy and less costly compliance, to update the tax system and to enact policies appropriate for different types of taxpayers.\n\nWhile the EOPT took effect on 22 January 2024, the implementing rules and regulations (IRR) are expected to be issued on or before the end of April 2024.\n\nFurther details are outlined below.\n\nThe Detail\n\n\n\nTaxpayers shall be able to file tax returns and pay corresponding taxes, either electronically or manually, to any district office of the Philippine Tax Authority (Bureau of Internal Revenue or BIR) or any authorised agent bank (AAB) of the BIR or through a tax software provider.\n\nIn relation to this, the 25% surcharge would no longer be imposed on account of filing and payment in a wrong venue.\n\n\n\nWe would expect that the BIR will still require taxpayers to indicate the specific BIR office/jurisdiction where they are registered for monitoring/crediting purposes.\n\n\n\nOverseas Contract Workers (OCWs) / Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) who work and derive income solely outside the Philippines are exempted from filing income tax returns.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, they may still be taxable if they derive income from within the Philippines.\n\n\n\nThe obligation to deduct and withhold tax shall now arise at the time when the income becomes payable.\n\nThe definition of the term “payable” has not been qualified. Under existing rules, however, “payable” refers to the date an income becomes due, demandable or legally enforceable.\n\n\n\nThe withholding of tax on income payments (expenses) being a prerequisite to a claim deduction has been removed.\n\n\n\nA 180-day period is provided for processing refunds of erroneously paid taxes from the date of submission of complete documents.\n\nTaxpayers may within 30 days from receipt of denial or after the expiration of 180 day period to appeal BIR’s decision with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA).\n\n\n\nIt must be shown that the income payment has been declared part of gross income and the fact of withholding is established.\n\nIn case of dissolution or cessation of business, application for refund applied for with BIR should be acted upon within 2 years from date of dissolution.\n\n\n\nAll books of accounts shall be preserved for a period of five (5) years from the day following the deadline in filing a return, or from the date of filing the return, whichever is later, for the taxable year when the least entry was made in the book of accounts.\n\nHow we can help\nOur team is very much happy to assist you in gaining a deeper understanding of the above.

        "content": "07 December 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nImpact High\n\nSummary\n\nQatar’s Ministry of Interior has revised specific regulations and procedures governing the entry process in connection with family residency and visit visas, effective immediately.\n\nThe Detail\n\nIn an effort to make the entry process more efficient and straightforward for families of residents planning to visit or reside in the state of Qatar, the Ministry of Interior has updated certain regulations and procedures. This initiative seeks to streamline visa processes for dependents inline with the State’s overarching approach.\n\nAccording to the revised procedures, the sponsorship of families is contingent upon the provisions outlined in the employee’s electronic work contract, particularly those related to salary and accommodation. The requirements include the following:\n\n● For Government and semi-government sectors, employees are required to secure family housing through their employer or maintain a monthly salary of no less than QAR 10,000, duly accredited with an employment contract.\n● For those in the private sector, the employee’s profession on the Qatar residence permit should fall under a certain category, technical or specialised fields. The salary amount should not be less than QAR 10,000 per month or QAR 6,000 per month with housing provided by the employer verified in the employment contract.\n● Furthermore, children within the mandatory education age bracket (six to eighteen years old) must be enrolled in schools within the country or should provide evidence of their education enrollment outside of the country. We reported on this in our last Qatar newsalert. This requirement is crucial during the issuance or renewal of their residence permit.\n● All dependent children should not exceed 25 years old and daughters must be unmarried. It is also mandatory to provide health insurance covering the entire duration of their stay, effective from the date of entry into the country.\n● With respect to family visit visas, the employee’s profession on the residency visa should have a non-labourer job title, with a salary not less than QAR 5,000 per month. The housing should be accredited by the relevant authorities. Visitors should be a relative to the sponsoring resident such as father, mother, brother and sister, with no specific age restriction. Health insurance coverage is mandatory for the whole period of stay in the country and can be purchased through the following link: https://www.moph.gov.qa/english/derpartments/policyaffairs/hfid/hirs/insurancecompanies/Pages/default.a spx\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe Minister of Interior has set out clear guidelines. Understanding the above requirements and changes to the renewal process for dependent children is important, to be able to plan family visits and renewal applications moving forward.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe will continue to closely monitor and provide timely guidance on any new updates announced by the Ministry of Interior and highlight the impact of any changes that may follow.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnir Chatterji\nEMEA Immigration Partner\nanir.chatterji@vialto.com\n\nRekha Simpson\nDirector, Middle East Immigration\nrekha.simpson@vialto.com\n\nMarilyn Serrao\nSenior Associate, Middle East Immigration\nmarilyn.serrao@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nContact us on the following address – me-immigration@vialto.com",

        "date": "December 22, 2023",
        "content": "21 December 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact Medium\n\nSummary\n\nThis bulletin provides a brief update for the upcoming year (2024) and summary of 2023 hot topics which impact the upcoming year too.\n\nThe Detail\n\nCross-Border Commuters\n\n● Changes in the withholding tax set-up for cross-border commuters from Italy into Switzerland and the grandfathering rule for existing Italian cross-borders. Moreover, a new home office rule (25%) is introduced for this population.\n● New regulations for cross-border commuters and teleworkers between Switzerland and France: The teleworkers are allowed to work remotely for up to two days per week (equivalent to 40% of work time) without impacting taxation rules, and this includes business trips within their resident country or a third country, not exceeding 10 days annually.\n\nTeleworking\n\n● On July 1, 2023 the new rules for teleworkers in the EU/EFTA were introduced, enabling telework in home office up to 49.9% in the home state (different from the employer state) without switching applicable social security law. The applicability is bound to various conditions and A1 is mandatory. Furthermore, the interaction with especially individual tax matters should not be neglected.\n\nImmigration – Increased spot checks to be expected for 2024\n\n● During the past few years, there has been an increasing number of authority spot checks on online notification.\n● This is also related to the increasing importance of PWD in the EU and the need to be compliant when sending employees to work in other countries.\n● Spot checks can be time-consuming and require a set of documents to be submitted with the authorities (such as pay slips, timesheet, letter of assignments, etc.)\n● It is recommended that companies do a thorough assessment of the activities of their foreign employees when working in Switzerland and obtain the right permit in time, if needed.\n● It is crucial that online notifications are submitted in time and that mandatory obligations such as Swiss reference salary are respected.\n\nImmigration – Work permit quotas for 2024\n\n● Based on the number of permits issued in the past years, the federal agency has decided that the work permit quotas for 2024 will remain the same as in 2023.\n● Considering that approximately 65% of the quota has been used up in 2023, there should be sufficient quota for 2024.\n\nImmigration – ETIAS update\n\n● The European Union has postponed the launch date of the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) until May 2025. The information has been confirmed by the European Commission and the new timeline is published in their official website.\n● ETIAS stands for European Travel Information and Authorisation System. It is a digital pre-travel authorisation that gives an individual ‘permission to travel’ to the Schengen zone.\n● The revised launch date is now anticipated to be in May 2025. Additional delays may occur if the EES (Entry-Exit-System) is not operational by that time. The expectation is that ETIAS will only enter into operation five to six months after the EES activation.\n● Visa free nationals to the Schengen zone will not require an ETIAS until mid-2025.\n\nDouble Tax Treaties\n\n● New double tax treaties: Ethiopia (as of 01.01.2024)\n● Updates on double tax treaties or underlying regulations: France, Germany, Italy, Slovenia, UAE\n\nSocial Security / Agreements\n\n● New social security treaties: Albania (01.10.2023); UK (as of 01.10.2023); Framework agreement for teleworkers\n● Basically Swiss social security contribution rates remain unchanged, there may be changes in the family allowance contributions in some Cantons.\n● Age of retirement levied for women born in or after 1964 to 65 years.\n● The “AHV 21” comes into force, for 2024 this means in a first phase especially\nincentives to continue work after retirement age as the contributions to be paid can now also have an influence on the state pension being paid out.\n\nHow we can help\n\nVialto Partners Switzerland is hosting a webcast on Wednesday, 24th January 2024, 9 – 10 am, which provides more insights about the changes briefly highlighted in this bulletin. The webcast will be available for registration in early 2024.\n\nMoreover, the bulletins published throughout the year might be interesting for you too (see links above) or follow us on LinkedIn for more upcoming alerts and events.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nNatalia Graf\nDirector\nnatalia.graf@vialto.com\n\nFranziska Tschirky\nSenior Manager\nfraniska.tschirky@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here:www.vialtopartners.com",

        "content": "Tax\n\nUnited Kingdom |  Changes to UK tax rules for “non-doms” from 06 April 2025\n\nSummary\nIn the UK Spring Budget, the Chancellor announced significant changes to the UK tax rules affecting individuals who are considered to be non-UK domiciled. For more than 110 years, the UK has operated a favourable regime, under which non-domiciled individuals could avoid UK tax on non-UK income and gains within the first 15 years of their tax residence in the UK by not remitting it to the UK. The Chancellor has now proposed a change to a residence based test which will continue to provide a favourable tax regime for certain qualifying individuals but with some key changes to the regime.\n\nThe detail\nThe key changes from 6 April 2025 are:\n\nWhat does this mean for employers of globally mobile employees? \nThe simplification of the regime, by removing the “remittance” rules is a clearly welcome step. However, the limitation of the “non-dom” rules to only 4 years may impact individuals planning to stay in the UK over the longer term. Access to the new regime is by election through the tax return.\n\nIndividuals who are already here may have questions about their status and the transition to the new rules. Employers will need to consider whether tax advice needs to be updated for those who arrived in the UK, so that they are clear with non-UK domiciled employees who pays any UK tax as a consequence of the new regime (even where the UK rates are lower for those who may qualify for transitional reliefs).\n\nEmployers of non-domiciled employees and “non doms” themselves have until April 2025 to prepare for the new regime. The transitional reliefs may enable individuals to bring foreign income and capital gains to the UK at favourable rates for the transitional years, but this will require detailed planning. Importantly the existing rules continue to apply in the 2023/24 or 2024/25 years, so individuals must take care to avoid any unintended remittances in the period leading up to 5 April 2025. Finally, the details of the proposals may change before enactment and it remains to be seen how a possible change in Government will affect how any future regime is implemented.\n\nIn the light of the above we recommend:\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAndy Fahey\nPartner\n\nBen van den Dungen\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Hong Kong | The 2025-26 Budget: innovate to grow and lead",
        "date": "February 26, 2025",
        "content": "Tax and Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nOn 26 February 2025, the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong SAR, Mr. Paul Chan, announced the Hong Kong 2025-26 Budget (the “Budget”).  With a complicated and changing economic environment, Hong Kong’s economy recorded a growth of 2.5 percent in 2024. In the midst of global changes, the Budget suggests driving economic growth with technology innovation as the core engine. Several talent, tax and immigration measures have also been proposed to support the growth and the government’s financial stability.\n\nIn this Alert, we highlight the proposals relevant to global mobility tax and immigration.\n\nThe details\n\nImmigration measure updates\n\n\n\n·       Application fee for a specified scheme application – HK$600\n\n·       Visa issuance fee for a visa with period of validity of not more than 180 days – HK$600\n\n·       Visa issuance fee for a visa with period of validity of more than 180 days – HK$1,300\n\nIndividual tax relief and measure\n\nDespite an estimated budget deficit of $87.2 billion, the Budget is proposing a one-off relief to reduce salaries tax and tax under personal assessment for year of assessment 2024/25 by 100%, subject to a ceiling of $1,500 in order to ease the burden on livelihoods. The reduction will be reflected in the final tax payable for the year of assessment 2024/25.\n\nIt is important to note that last year’s budget included a measure to increase the tax rate for high-income earners. Beginning with the 2024/25 assessment year, a two-tier standard rate regime will be implemented, where individuals with a net income up to $5,000,000 will be taxed at 15%, while the residual income exceeding $5,000,000 will be taxed at 16%.  The government estimated that around 12,000 taxpayers would be impacted.\n\nThis year, the proposal aims to maintain the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s straightforward and low tax regime, with a focus on avoiding significant tax rate increases or the introduction of new taxes.  Although there is no adjustment to the personal allowances under salaries tax, there is no increase to the current tax rates, which is welcome news to the public and international talents who are contemplating to move to Hong Kong.  Appendix 1 shows a summary of the current and proposed Tax Rates, Allowances, and Deductions under Salaries Tax.\n\nTreaty Network Expansion\n\nTo expand Hong Kong’s trade network and attract more inward investment and enterprises from the Global South markets to Hong Kong, the Government is exploring the signing of investment agreements with Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Egypt and Peru, and conducting negotiations with 17 countries on Comprehensive Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements.\n\nOur observation\n\nThe 2025/26 budget announcement reflects a balanced approach aimed at fostering economic growth amidst the challenging global economic environment. It proposes flexibility and facilitation measures under different talent admission schemes to further enhance the attractiveness of the existing immigration schemes. We will wait for further details about these measures which will facilitate the global or cross-border move of employees.\n\nEmployers are encouraged to take advantage of the enhanced talent attraction schemes and the stable tax environment while considering the new visa fee structure when budgeting for employee relocations to Hong Kong.\n\nOverall, we welcome the government’s commitment to maintaining a simple and low tax regime, which is crucial for preserving Hong Kong’s attractiveness to talents and promoting inbound mobility. The expansion of the tax treaty network will not only foster more business development opportunities, but also facilitate international talent movement. Both employers and employees should remain informed about the upcoming changes and plan ahead accordingly.\n\n[Percentage % x (Income – Allowable Expenses – Depreciation Allowances)]\n\n* From year 2024/25, increase to $120,000 if taxpayer resides with first child born on or after 25 October 2023 until the child reaches the age of 18.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nJames Clemence\nAsia Pacific CEO\n\nBruce Lee\nHong Kong SAR Territorial Leader\n\nAdam Chiu\nPartner\n\nSteven Lim\nPartner\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nOman | Oman set to be the first Gulf country to introduce income tax\n\nSummary\n\nOman may soon become the first Gulf nation to introduce a personal income tax (PIT), as it seeks to diversify revenue streams beyond oil in line with its Vision 2040 plan.\n\nThe Detail\n\nThe proposed PIT legislation has been moved from Oman’s Shura Council to the State Council, indicating strong legislative momentum. The Council of State is expected to make only technical comments, suggesting a high likelihood of enactment. This tax framework aims to reduce Oman’s dependence on oil revenue, ensuring fiscal sustainability and funding public services and infrastructure. The proposed tax will apply to:\n\nHowever, the exact rates and further details are still to be finalized. It is anticipated that the tax levy may be defined in 2024 and potentially come into effect from January 2025.It may be noted however that the initial bill was first introduced with implementation initially planned for 2023.\n\nWhat this means\n\nIf passed, the PIT will be the first of its kind in the GCC region, impacting high-earning foreign workers and wealthy Omani citizens. The introduction of PIT is seen as essential for reducing Oman’s fiscal deficit and ensuring long-term economic stability, especially given the volatility of oil prices. This legislation will provide a stable and diversified revenue stream, enabling additional investment in public services, infrastructure, and social programs.\n\nWhile Oman’s proactive stance on PIT might serve as a blueprint for similar reforms in the Gulf region, it appears unlikely that other GCC countries will follow in the near future. Earlier this year, both Saudi Arabia and the UAE reaffirmed their firm stances against introducing PIT. Additionally, tax reform proposals in the GCC, such as Bahrain’s exploration of remittance taxes in 2023, have rarely progressed. However, Oman’s proposal to push forward with a personal income tax framework could still encourage other GCC countries to consider similar tax reforms in the future.\n\nHow we can help\n\nAt Vialto Partners, we can help you navigate these changes by:\n\nOur team is dedicated to assisting both employers and employees navigate these changes effectively.

USCIS says it may implement the provisions in stages through one or more final rules so that some of the provisions may take effect for the FY2025 H-1B cap process.\n\nSpecific highlights of the proposed rule include:\n\nThe detail\n\nBelow is a summary of the provisions of the proposed new rules and their impact on the H-1B program.\n\nWhat this means\n\nUSCIS is proposing new rules to modernize the H-1B program but they will not take effect until they clear the federal review process, which typically takes several months. Currently, USCIS is accepting public comments until December 22, 2023. After the 60-day public comment period, considering the received comments, USCIS will finalize the rule’s provisions through one or more final rules. The agency has indicated that H-1B cap anti-fraud provisions are a priority, so those provisions may be among the first to be finalized to come into effect for the FY2025 H-1B cap process.  If the proposed rule is implemented, it would curtail fraud in the H-1B cap lottery process and increase an H-1B candidate’s opportunity to be selected under the lottery.  The proposed rule should also streamline USCIS processes and ultimately reduce the backlogs in adjudications.\n\nContact us\n\nManish Daftari\nPartner\nmanish.daftari@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com",

        "date": "September 7, 2023",
        "content": "4 September 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact: Medium\n\nSummary\n\nThe bulletin provides an update about the changes which have been implemented or agreed on during the summertime.\n\nThe Detail\nGeneva parental leave\n\nIn June Geneva had a vote on parental leave which was accepted by the majority of voters. This has an impact on the benefits new parents receive from the government in Geneva but also on the Geneva social security contributions, as this additional parental leave will be financed by the contributions made by the employer and employee to the Geneva’s maternity insurance scheme. The total contribution may raise by 0.15% – 0.2%. The new rules are also applicable for parents with same sex, adoptive parents or permanent foster care parents. While the additional contributions are mandatory the granting of the additional benefit is voluntary.\n\n*The additional parental leave will be 8 weeks in total whereas at least 6 out of 8 weeks are compulsory allocated to the father resp. the person who does not benefit from the maternity insurance. The remaining two weeks can be allocated between the parents based on their agreement.\n\nAs a reminder, any employer who has employees working in the canton of Geneva may be impacted by this change. Be prepared for the necessary changes which need to be implemented into your payroll program. The exact date enforcement is not yet announced.\n\nMinimum wages\n\nThe two biggest cities in the canton of Zurich (Zurich and Winterthur) had separate votes on minimum wages for work performed in their ground. The majority of the people of these cities have voted YES. Consequently, employers must carefully assess their wage structure.\n\nMoreover, we like to provide you with some background information for Switzerland on minimum wages. Such initiative was declined on a federal level in 2014 by the Swiss residents as the majority voted NO for a Swiss wide minimum wage requirement. Nonetheless, several cantons have implemented minimum wages in the meantime. Please see the table below.\n\nSummary of Bulletin and other Tax Blogs published during the summertime\n\nExecutive employee Art. 15 (4) Switzerland / Germany DTT\n\nThere has been an adjustment of Article 15(4) of the Consultation Agreement of August 11, 1971 between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation on Income and on Capital (DTT CH-D).\n\nBulletin July 11, 2023\n\nFrench cross border\n\nSwitzerland and France have signed a supplemental agreement containing rules for taxation of income from home office activity for cross-border commuters (applicable in principle until 31st December 2024). In July, the tax authorities published further clarifications in particular on the details of the 40% incl. 10 business trip calculation and the impact of exceeding days.\n\nFlyer August 11, 2023\n\nTeleworking agreement\n\nAs of 1 July 2023 the Framework Agreement for Telework has entered into force. This agreement entails that Member States agree to deviate from the main rules as included in the EU-Regulation for social security if a situation meets certain criteria. Under the Framework Agreement for Teleworkers, a cross-border teleworker can continue coverage in the employer country when combining working in the employer country with less than 50% teleworking from their residency country.\n\nCross-border telework is defined as an activity that can be pursued from any location, carried out in a Member State other than the one in which the employer is vested and is based on information technology to remain connected to the employer’s or business environment. In practice this means that an employee can work in their home country from different locations (and not only from home) as long as they work via ‘information technology’ for their employer who is vested in another Member State.\n\nThe Framework Agreement for Telework will not be applied by all EU/EEA countries.\n\nInsight June 30, 2023\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nNatalia Graf\n\nDirector\n\nnatalia.graf@vialto.com\n\nFranziska Tschirky\n\nSenior Manager\n\nfranziska.tschirky@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "April 10, 2024",
        "content": "On Friday 5 April 2024, the ADEM employment agency announced the publication of the 2024 list of shortage occupations in Luxembourg. This list has been published in the Official Journal (Journal Officiel du Grand-Duché de Luxembourg) and is also available on the ADEM website.\n\nThis list establishes the jobs that are most in demand among recruiters and for which very few (or no) candidates are available from ADEM. Luxembourg is currently experiencing a significant shortage of qualified candidates in 24 specific job sectors (compared to 30 last year), including finance, IT, engineering, health and personal care, social work, and business support services (human resources, accounting, audit, and legal advice).\n\nTo ensure that the list of shortage occupations corresponds as closely as possible to the reality of the job market, it is key that employers declare all their vacant positions to ADEM. This list is also used to better analyze the qualifications and skills that employers need and to organize targeted training courses for jobseekers in the identified professions.\n\n1/ ADEM certificates issued faster for shortage occupations \nEmployers can make the application for a “foreign workforce” (main-d’œuvre étrangère) certificate directly when declaring a vacant position to ADEM, or subsequently, during the entire validity period of the offer. If the declared position corresponds to a profession on the list of shortage occupations, the certificate is issued within five working days following acknowledgment of receipt.\n\nFor jobs that are not on the list of labor shortage, the market test will continue to be carried out but with shorter deadlines. ADEM will have seven working days to check whether jobseekers fulfilling the profile required for the declared position are available. If no candidate can be proposed, the certificate will be issued, after the seven-day deadline, within the next five working days. If ADEM can propose candidates corresponding to the profile, they will have 15 additional working days to suggest candidates to the employer.\n\n2/ Lower minimum salary threshold to apply for EU blue Card for shortage occupations\nForeign employees with a salary of minimum 70.762 euros (the salary threshold for shortage occupations for EU Blue Card holders has recently increased), and with a profession that is on the list of labor shortage, can be eligible for the EU Blue Card.\n\nEmployers hiring third country nationals should review the updated list of shortage occupations to check whether some of their occupations are listed there as they could benefit from hiring facilitation (no labor market test and potential eligibility to the EU Blue Card).\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMaud Aupetit\nSenior Manager\n\nRebecca Serval\nAssociate\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit: www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "New Zealand | Immigration | Potential immigration policy changes",
        "date": "December 7, 2023",
        "content": "December 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nMedium\n\nSummary\n\nSix weeks after New Zealand’s election, a new coalition Government has been formed between the National, Act and New Zealand First (NZ First) parties. There are two coalition agreements, National-Act and National-NZ First, which set out the direction of immigration policy changes.\n\nThe Detail\n\nThe immigration portfolio has been split between National and NZ First, with Erica Standford (National) as the Minister of Immigration, and Chris Fenk (National) and Casey Castello (NZ First) as the Associate Ministers.\n\nUnder the National-Act agreement, the Government has committed to:\n\n● Remove median wage requirements for Skilled Migrant Category visas\n● Introduce a five-year, renewable parent category visa, conditional on covering healthcare costs\n● Make it easier for family members of visa holders to work in New Zealand\n● Increase the cap on Recognised Seasonal Employer Scheme workers\n\nUnder the National-NZ First agreement, the Government has committed to:\n\n● Improve the Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) scheme to focus on workforce needs\n● Ensure Immigration New Zealand does “proper risk management and verification to ensure migrants are filling genuine workforce needs”\n● Investigate the establishment of an “Essential Worker” workforce planning mechanism to better manage long-term labour or skill shortages\n● Commit to enforcement and action against those found responsible for the abuse of migrant workers to make sure they face the right consequences\n● Address and provide solutions for the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development (OECD)’s concerns about the lack of focus in New Zealand Immigration policy\n\nAcross the two agreements there are also proposed employment changes that may impact immigration, such as:\n\n● Strengthening obligations on work-ready beneficiaries to find work\n● Better recognition of overseas medical qualifications and experience\n● Committing to moderate increases to the minimum wage each year\n● Repealing the Fair Pay Agreement regime\n● Expanding 90-day trials to apply to all businesses\n● Reviewing Health and Safety legislation\n● Simplifying personal grievances; removing eligibility for remedies if the employee is at fault; setting an income threshold above which a personal grievance cannot be pursued.\n\nWhat this means\n\nWhile details of these policies and their implementation are still to come, we can anticipate further considerations required for some proposals as follows.\n\nThe New Zealand government’s coalition agreements relating to immigration exhibit a mix of continuity and proposed adjustments, but overall, few remarkable shifts. A notable feature is the maintenance of the AEWV scheme, with no immediate plans for review, despite pre-election criticism.\n\nThe proposed improvements to the AEWV present a nuanced approach. While the streamlining of processes for skilled workers aligns with meeting employers needs, the increased obligations on Job Seeker beneficiaries might suggest a tightening of scrutiny on certain roles.\n\nThe emphasis on risk management and verification will help to ensure migrant workers meet workforce needs, and alongside the commitment for enforcement and actions against migrant workers, will help to reduce exploitation risks. However, additional verification could also lead to delays in visa application processing, impacting businesses with immediate staffing requirements. Increased monitoring and resources for compliance checks and investigations would also be necessary for effective migrant protection policies.\n\nThe establishment of an Essential Worker planning mechanism is a strategic move to address long-term skills shortages but might face administrative challenges and take time to become fully effective. How this mechanism will be distinct from the Green List occupation inclusion process is worth monitoring.\n\nPre-election we noticed few parties address the need for immigration planning that takes account of New Zealand’s demographic and economic trajectory, and successive governments have struggled to formulate a focused immigration policy. It will be interesting to see the level of priority assigned to this commitment over the next three years.\n\nThe removal of median wage requirements may support industries like agriculture, tourism, and hospitality but could also raise concerns about wage suppression in these sectors.\n\nThe Five-Year Renewable Parent Category Visa is positive news for migrants who have struggled to meet the high-income thresholds in the current policy. The longer-term temporary visa addresses family reunification needs while mitigating potential long-term health service burdens.\n\nFacilitating work for family members may signal a reverse of the policy introduced on 1 May 2023 that imposed conditions on certain partner work visas. This change would make it easier for partners of AEWV holders to seek employment and ensure more equitable work rights for eligible partners across various industries.\n\nIn summary, the Coalition agreements reflect the need for the new Government to balance a desire to be more facilitative to employers while simultaneously focussing on risk management and verification. The success of these policies will depend on their effective implementation and adaptability to socio economic changes\n\nHow we can help\n\nOur New Zealand immigration team will be keeping a close eye on these policy developments. We will provide submissions and input as the opportunities arise and will continue to share updates. Meanwhile, we expect existing regulations and systems to remain in place for at least 3 to 6 months. Our team is committed to helping business, teams and assignees manage the visa application processes with ease, and is available to assist with:\n\n● Immigration briefings and eligibility assessments\n● Preparation of visa applications\n● Human Resources team workshops\n● Immigration strategy and compliance.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nJaq Chong\nSenior Manager, Licensed Immigration Adviser \njaq.chong@vialtopartners.com\n\nKim Gibbs\nManager, Licensed Immigration Adviser \nkim.gibbs@vialtopartners.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "date": "August 7, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nThailand | Destination Thailand Visa (DTV)\n\nSummary\n\nStarting from July 15, 2024, the new Destination Thailand Visa (DTV) is available for remote workers, digital nomads, and freelancers who would like to stay for a longer-term in Thailand. This visa allows expatriates to travel and work remotely or engage in Thai soft power activities in Thailand, granting them a stay of up to 180 days per visit, with a validity of five years.  Details are as follows:\n\n\n\n1.   Purpose of visit\n\n\n\n1.   For foreigners who wish to travel and work remotely in Thailand\n\n\n\n1.1   Foreigners looking for an extended vacation and wishing to work remotely in Thailand e.g. digital nomads/remote workers/foreign talents/freelancers.\n\n1.2   Foreigners interested in Thai soft power related activities e.g. Thai boxing (Muay Thai) and self-defense techniques, cooking classes, sports training sessions, medical treatments, educational seminars, and art & music exhibitions.\n\n\n\n2.   Spouse and children under 20 years old of DTV visa holders\n\n\n\n4.  Duration of stays\n\n\n\nStay up to 180 days per visit, with unlimited entries allowed within a\n\n5-year period.\n\n\n\nOnce the expatriates reach the 180 days limit, they can apply for an extension of additional 180 days (subject to an extra fee). After extending the stay (totaling 360 days), they must exit Thailand and re-enter with their valid DTV Visa.\n\n\n\n5.  Where to apply?\n\n\n\nRoyal Thai Embassy or Royal Thai Consulate-General in your area or https://www.thaievisa.go.th/\n\n\n\n\n\n6.  Requested documents regarding the DTV Visa\n\n\n\n1.   Biodata page of Passport or Travel Document\n\n2.   Photograph taken within the last six months\n\n3.   Document indicating current location e.g. driving license, bank statement, or proof of stay\n\n4.   Financial evidence: amount of no less than 500,000 THB, e.g. bank statements, sponsorship letter\n\n\n\n\n\n7.  Other supporting documents\n\n\n\nGroup 1: Foreign remote workers, digital nomads, and freelancers\n\nSupporting documents: Employment contract/ employment certificate from your foreign company, or a professional portfolio showing your freelancer work, etc.\n\n\n\nGroup 2: Thai Soft Power activities\n\nSupporting documents: Proof of confirmation to attend such activities in Thailand or an appointment from a hospital/medical center, etc.\n\n\n\nGroup 3: Dependent of Primary DTV Holder (Spouse and Child not over 20 years old)\n\nSupporting documents: Marriage certificate, birth certificate, or certificate of adoption.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.     Fee\n\n\n\nThe DTV fee is Baht 10,000 and may vary depending on the embassy in each country.

        "title": "United Kingdom | Immigration | Home Office will not pursue appeal in EU Settlement Scheme case but uncertainty remains for employers",
        "date": "March 7, 2023",
        "content": "03 March 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nOn 15 February 2023, the Home Office confirmed that the government will not appeal the High Court’s judgement in relation to the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS). Whilst details of how the Home Office will implement the High Court decision have not been announced yet, it would mean that individuals with pre-settled status no longer risk losing their right to reside in the UK if they fail to make a second application to remain before their pre-settled status expires. Furthermore, those with pre-settled status will acquire permanent residence under the Withdrawal Agreement automatically once the conditions for it are met, even if they do not make a second application for settled status under the scheme. This is positive news for the more than 2 million individuals with pre-settled status but the details of how the change will impact employers’ duties, in practice, are not yet clear.\n\nThe Detail\n\nFrom 1 January 2021, EU citizens and their family members have not been able to rely on free movement rights under EU law to reside in the UK. However, those resident in the UK by 31 December 2020, who continued to reside in the country, had their residence rights protected by the Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement also gave the UK the right to require those EU citizens and their family members apply for a new residence status and a document evidencing that status. The UK government established the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) for that purpose.\n\nUnder the EUSS, those who resided in the UK for at least five years by 31 December 2020 were able to apply for settled status, giving them Indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK. Those residing in the UK for less than five years by that time were eligible to apply for pre-settled status, which gave them a 5-year period of Limited Leave to Remain in the UK.\n\nBefore the end of the 5-year period, those with pre-settled status who wanted to continue residing in the UK were required to either make a second application for pre-settled status, settled status or permission to reside on another immigration route, if they qualified.\n\nIn its judgement of 21 December 2022, the High Court decided that the EUSS requirement for those with pre-settled status to make a second application in order to continue residing in the UK was unlawful under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement The High Court also confirmed that those with pre-settled status automatically acquire settled status under the Withdrawal Agreement, once the conditions for it are met – that is, they do not need to apply to obtain it.\n\nThe Home Office initially planned to appeal the High Court’s judgement, however, on 15 February 2023 the government confirmed it will not proceed with the appeal to ‘provide clarity and certainty’ to the around 2 million individuals with pre-settled status living in the UK.\n\nRecommended Action\n\nIn its statement, the Home Office confirmed it will take steps to amend the digital status of those with pre-settled status ‘to clarify that their right to stay does not expire after five years’. The Home Office has not confirmed yet how long that process will take or how the change will affect the timings of your duty to conduct Right to Work checks. Once we have the details, we will provide further insights.\n\nIn the meantime, we would advise businesses to continue to conduct a Right to Work check on employees with pre-settled status before they begin work and again before the date their records show a worker’s pre-settled status expires.\n\nAlthough the High Court judgement means that those with pre-settled status are no longer required to apply to the EUSS to acquire setted status, on a practical level, it may be difficult for them to evidence their settled status to employers. It is still open for them to apply to the EUSS for evidence of their settled status and employers may wish to support these applications to give certainty to their workers and the business until the Home Office provides further clarification.\n\nHow we can help\n\nIf you have employees who hold pre-settled status under the EUSS who require assistance, or if you would like further clarification on the practical implications for your business, please do not hesitate to speak with your dedicated Vialto team.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "29 September 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact : Medium\n\nSummary\n\nThe Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) recently issued a Notice announcing the effective date for the amendments introduced by the Finance Act 2023. The main details from an employment tax perspective are outlined in this bulletin.\n\nThe Detail\n\nFinance Act 2023 contains an amendment to the personal relief section of the Personal Income Tax Act (section 33(3d)) Finance Act 2023). This is the section that grants tax reliefs for premium paid by an individual during the year preceding the year of assessment to an insurance company in respect to:\n\n• life insurance on self or your spouse; and\n• contract for a deferred annuity on self or your spouse\n\nThis amended tax provision introduces a condition to enjoy tax relief on deferred annuity. In order to qualify for the tax relief, a taxpayer must not make any withdrawal on their contract for deferred annuity for 5 years or more.

        "title": "Canada | Immigration | Temporary implementation of a cap on the international student permit applications; changes to post-graduate and open spousal work permit eligibility",
        "date": "February 2, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nCanada : Temporary implementation of a cap on the international student permit applications; changes to post-graduate and open spousal work permit eligibility\n\nSummary\nThe Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship (IRCC) announced this week that the Government of Canada will introduce a number of changes to Canada’s international student program, including: changes to eligibility for a post-graduate work permit; restrictions on eligibility criteria for open work permits for spouses of students; and, notably, the introduction of an intake cap on international student permit applications for a period of two years. The reason provided by the government for the temporary measure is to tighten integrity controls within the international student program and alleviate the pressure on housing, health care and other services in Canada.\n\nThe Detail\n\nCap on Study Permit applications\nEffective immediately and for the next two years, IRCC will impose an intake cap on the number of international study permit applications that will be accepted for processing. IRCC confirmed that this cap will result in approximately 360,000 approved study permits in 2024, reflecting a 35% reduction from 2023. The intake level will be reassessed in 2025.\n\nUnder the proposed cap on study permits, the provinces and territories will each have a limit on their ability to welcome new international students. The cap will not impact existing study permit holders, study permit renewals, or those pursuing master’s and doctoral degrees or other post graduate programs. Study permit applications at the elementary and secondary school levels will also be exempt.\n\nEffective January 22, 2024, all study permit applications submitted to IRCC must include an attestation letter from a province or territory. As each province and territory will have until March 31, 2024 to establish the process for issuing these letters, applicants can expect delays in the processing of study permits until then.\n\nChanges to Post-graduate work permits\nFurther, IRCC announced changes to the eligibility criteria of the Post Graduation Work Permit (PGWP). Starting September 2024, international students enrolled in programs delivered via public-private partnerships (such as private colleges operating under a curriculum licensing arrangement), will no longer be eligible to apply for a PGWP.\n\nIRCC has also announced that international students who have graduated from masters programs or other short graduate level programs will be able to apply for a 3-year work permit, regardless of the duration of their program of study. Previously, such candidates could only obtain a PGWP for a period of time that did not exceed the duration of their program of study.\n\nOpen Spousal Work Permit eligibility\nIn the coming weeks, IRCC will also amend the eligibility requirements for open spousal work permits as they relate to dependent spouses or common-law partners of international students. Specifically, only spouses or partners of students in master’s and doctoral programs will be eligible; spouses of international students in other levels of study, including undergraduate and college programs, will no longer be eligible for an open work permit and would need to apply on their own merits.\n\nWhat this means\nThe latest reforms are expected to impact not only international students seeking to apply for a first work permit, but also recent graduates and dependents of international students. For employers who currently have employees working on an open work permit granted by virtue of their spouse’s student status in an undergraduate or college-level program, note that they may continue working on the basis of that permit. However, companies should be aware that they may need to convert to another work permit category or permanent residence in order to extend their work authorization. Similarly, for companies with a campus recruitment program, it’s recommended to discuss these changes and their impact with the relevant team, as post-graduate work permit eligibility will depend largely on the institutions from which their degrees were obtained. At this time, there are no changes to co-op work permits or eligibility for off-campus work. As the international student program appears to be an area of IRCC’s focus at this time, we note that further changes or clarification on the latest updates may be expected. Reach out to your Vialto team member with any questions or for strategic guidance.\n\nWant to learn more?\nFor further details regarding this, or any other immigration matter, please contact a member of our team at Vialto Partners LLP.\n\nCanada: Mise en place temporaire d’un plafond national de réception des demandes de permis d’études; modifications de l’admissibilité aux permis de travail postdiplômes et permis ouverts pour les conjoints\n\nEn bref\nL’honorable Marc Miller, ministre de l’Immigration, des Réfugiés et de la Citoyenneté (IRCC), a annoncé cette semaine que le gouvernement du Canada apportera un certain nombre de changements au programme d’études canadien pour les étudiants étrangers, y compris: des changements à l’admissibilité au permis de travail postdiplôme; des restrictions sur les critères d’admissibilité aux permis de travail ouverts pour les conjoints des étudiants; et, notamment, l’introduction d’un plafond de réception des demandes de permis d’études pour une période de deux ans. La raison invoquée par le gouvernement pour justifier cette mesure temporaire est de renforcer les contrôles d’intégrité des programmes d’études pour les étudiants étrangers et d’alléger la pression sur le logement, les soins de santé et d’autres services au Canada.\n\nEn détail\n\nPlafond sur les demandes de permis d’études\nDès maintenant et pour les deux prochaines années, IRCC imposera un plafond d’admission au nombre de demandes de permis d’études qui seront acceptés pour faire l’objet de traitement. IRCC a confirmé que ce plafond se traduira par une approbation d’environ 360 000 permis d’études en 2024, ce qui reflète une réduction de 35 % par rapport à 2023. Le nombre d’admission des demandes sera réévalué en 2025.\n\nSelon le plafond proposé sur les permis d’études, les provinces et les territoires auront chacun une limite quant à leur capacité d’accueillir de nouveaux étudiants étrangers. Le plafond n’aura aucune incidence sur les détenteurs de permis d’études existants, les renouvellements de permis d’études ou ceux qui poursuivent des études de maîtrise et de doctorat ou d’autres programmes d’études supérieures. Les demandes de permis d’études aux niveaux primaire et secondaire seront également exonérées.\n\nDepuis le 22 janvier 2024, toutes les demandes de permis d’études soumises à IRCC doivent inclure une lettre d’attestation d’une province ou d’un territoire. Comme chaque province et territoire aura jusqu’au 31 mars 2024 pour établir le processus de délivrance de ces lettres, les candidats peuvent s’attendre à des retards dans le traitement des permis d’études d’ici là.\n\nChangements aux permis de travail postdiplômes\nEn outre, IRCC a annoncé des modifications aux critères d’éligibilité du permis de travail postdiplôme. À partir de septembre 2024, les étudiants étrangers inscrits à des programmes dispensés via des partenariats public-privé (tels que les collèges privés fonctionnant dans le cadre d’un accord d’utilisation des programmes d’études) ne pourront plus postuler à un permis de travail postdiplôme.\n\nIRCC a également annoncé que les diplômés de programmes de maîtrise et d’autres courts programmes d’études supérieures pourront bientôt demander un permis de travail de trois ans, quelle que soit la durée de leur programme d’études. Auparavant, ces candidats ne pouvaient obtenir un permis de travail postdiplôme que pour une période n’excédant pas la durée de leur programme d’études.\n\nÉligibilité aux permis ouverts pour les conjoints\nDans les prochaines semaines, IRCC va également modifier les critères d’éligibilité pour les permis ouverts des époux et conjoints de faits des étudiants étrangers. Plus précisément, seuls les époux ou conjoints des étudiants de programmes de maîtrise ou de doctorat seront éligibles; les conjoints des étudiants aux autres niveaux d’études, incluant les programmes collégiaux ou de premier cycle, ne seront plus éligibles pour un permis de travail ouvert et devront faire une demande selon leur propre mérite.\n\nQu’est-ce que cela signifie\nIl est attendu que les dernières réformes auront un impact non seulement sur les étudiants étrangers cherchant à obtenir un premier permis de travail, mais également sur les récents diplômés et les personnes à charge des étudiants étrangers. Pour les employeurs dont les employés travaillent actuellement avec un permis de travail ouvert accordé en vertu du statut d’étudiant de leur conjoint dans un programme de premier cycle ou de niveau collégial, notez qu’ils peuvent continuer à travailler sur la base de ce permis. Cependant, les entreprises doivent être conscientes qu’elles devront possiblement convertir à une autre catégorie de permis de travail ou résidence permanente afin de prolonger l’autorisation de travail de ces travailleurs. De même, pour les entreprises disposant d’un programme de recrutement sur campus, il est recommandé de discuter de ces changements et de leur impact avec l’équipe de recrutement concernée, car l’éligibilité au permis de travail post-universitaire dépendra en grande partie des établissements auprès desquels leurs diplômes ont été obtenus. Pour le moment, il n’y a aucun changement concernant les permis de travail coop ou l’admissibilité au travail hors campus. Comme le programme des étudiants étrangers semble être un domaine d’intérêt pour IRCC en ce moment, nous notons que d’autres changements ou clarifications sur les dernières mises à jour peuvent être attendus.

        "content": "20 September 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact : Medium\n\nSummary\n\nOn 16 August 2023, the Federal Cabinet approved the government draft for a so-called “Future Financing Act”. The changes are to come into force from 2024.\n\nThe Detail\n\nAmong other things, the change in employee profit-sharing is planned. The annual tax-free allowance for gratuitous or discounted employee shareholdings from the employer to employees for qualifying plans is to be increased from currently EUR 1,440 to EUR 5,000.\n\nEmployee shareholdings in the context of deferred compensation are only tax-free up to the amount of EUR 2,000. If the monetary benefit exceeds EUR 2,000, the profit-sharing is only tax-free if it is granted in addition to the salary owed anyway.\n\nFurthermore, a mitigation of the problem is foreseen that in the case of a taxable benefit-in-kind by transferring a shareholding to employees without liquid funds having accrued to them, this leads to the tax burden exceeding the net salary (so-called dry-income). However, these regulations only apply to companies of a certain size.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnna Liepelt, Senior Manager | anna.l.liepelt@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "United Kingdom | Tax | Recent mobility & employment tax round up",
        "date": "March 7, 2023",
        "content": "7 March 2023\n\nGlobal Mobility Tax\n\nImpact: Low\n\nSummary\n\nA round up of recent UK employment tax, social security and immigration updates relevant to global mobility employers and our UK Vialto outlook for 2023.\n\nIntroduction of online route to submit amended Forms P11D and/or P11D(b)\n\nCurrently, any amendments to Forms P11D/Form P11D(b) can only be made on paper and posted to HMRC; from 6 April 2023 all amended returns must be filed online. HMRC is launching a new online submission link to allow employers to so file; HMRC will provide further details in the April Employer Bulletin.\n\nThis will particularly be of benefit for employers of globally mobile employees, enabling any errors as regards expat related benefits to be reported to HMRC in a more timely and efficient manner.\n\nSalary advances\n\nAn increasing number of employers are allowing employees (whether directly or via a third party) to access some of their earned salary before their normal pay day. HMRC outlined its view on the proper reporting of these salary advances in Agent Update 102. Given the increased administrative burdens of this approach, HMRC announced they will amend secondary legislation to enable such salary advances to be reported on or before the employee’s contractual pay day. Further information, including plans to update guidance, will appear in future editions of HMRC’s Employer Bulletin.\n\nGroup Income Protection provided under salary sacrifice arrangements\n\nGroup Income Protection (GIP) policies are insurance policies designed to provide employees with a regular income if they cannot work because of long-term sickness or injury. How premiums and any subsequent payments made under the policy are treated from an employment tax perspective depends on a number of factors, particularly whether the premiums are deemed to be employer or employee funded.\n\nComplexities arose following the introduction of the Optional Remuneration Arrangement (OpRA) rules. Whilst historically HMRC broadly accepted that premiums taxed as a benefit under the OpRA rules would count as employee contributions for the purposes of the broader income tax position, HMRC now considers that the fact the premiums may have been taxed under the OpRA rules has no impact on the treatment of any payments. This means that where an employer premium is taxable under the OpRA rules, the employee will suffer tax on both the premium and any subsequent payments made under the GIP.\n\nHelpfully, HMRC has confirmed it will not seek to challenge the historic position and, where employers were relying on historic guidance, broadly they may continue to rely on this until 31 December 2023. Employers should document where reliance has been placed on previous guidance. They should also review any GIP arrangements to ensure any premiums are correctly being reported, where provided under a salary sacrifice arrangement, and ensure any relevant payments (or portion thereof) are processed via the payroll for income tax and National Insurance purposes.\n\n2022/23 ERS return changes\n\nHMRC has announced some minor changes to the content of the UK employment related securities returns for 2022/23 and has updated its guidance and technical notes. Full details are included in our news alerts here. The main change of interest for employers with globally mobile employees will be that provision of employee National Insurance numbers is mandatory and, if any award holder does not have a National Insurance number, employers will need to report both a reason (for instance that they are on an expat assignment and are exempt from National Insurance) and the person’s date of birth. As such, we recommend employers start data gathering a little earlier this year to be ready.\n\nOTS report on hybrid and distance working\n\nThe Office of Tax Simplification has published its findings from the call for evidence on hybrid and distance working, both domestically within the UK and also internationally. Employers will welcome the large number of simplification suggestions in the report, intended to make it easier to manage new ways of working (remote, digital nomad, hybrid) compliantly, and also confirmation in the report on HMRC’s position on certain queries (for example allowing A1s for remote workers). We await to see how many of the recommendations, including those suggested by Vialto Partners, will be accepted and implemented.\n\nUK compliance watch\n\nWe’ve seen an increase in HMRC activity on compliance letters, with recent letters being sent out regarding the following:\n\nIf you receive any HMRC compliance letters, do reach out to your Vialto contact who would be happy to advise.\n\nMaking Tax Digital\n\nUnsurprisingly, Making Tax Digital for income tax (MTD) has been delayed by another two years until April 2026. MTD is an HMRC project to require taxpayers with income from property or self-employment to use software to keep the financial records on these matters, and to file regular tax reports on these items electronically. Users will need to keep digital records and file quarterly through MTD software and a year end declaration, rather than the traditional income tax return. This would affect landlords, e.g. expats who rent out their UK home while abroad.\n\nFrom 6 April 2026, landlords with rental income (not profit) of more than £50,000 will fall into MTD. This will be extended to those with rental income above £30,000 from 6 April 2027. Self-employed individuals will also be brought in from April 2026. The delay gives more time to HMRC to consider the complexities of MTD.\n\nTo date, HMRC has not issued any guidance to developers of the software in respect of key considerations for globally mobile employees, such as residency and foreign income considerations. As April 2026 looms closer and more guidance is issued by HMRC, a key consideration for global mobile employers is the impact on tax support for expat employees: the MTD regime is very different from the current annual tax return filing.\n\nThis section is a quick look ahead to some of the developments we are expecting this year across tax, social security and immigration.\n\nUK Spring Budget\n\nAfter the many budget updates last autumn, the next UK spring budget is on 15th March. It may well be a quiet budget from a global mobility standpoint but we could see:\n\nUK-Brazil Double Taxation Agreement (DTA)\n\nWe are awaiting ratification of the new UK-Brazil DTA and confirmation of when it will come into force. Currently the UK and Brazil only have limited agreements, so a comprehensive treaty covering residence and employment income for the first time is very welcome news!\n\nIncrease in Sponsor Licence Audits and Compliance\n\nThe Home Office has doubled the size of their sponsorship team to attempt to meet its goals of returning services and processing times to normal levels and preparing for increased volume in 2023. The team now has around 50 compliance officers in total who visit sponsors in order to conduct compliance visits. The visits will either be sector led, whereby they decide to target certain sectors of the market, or the visits will be intelligence led which means they may have pre-existing concerns about a specific business. Visits can be announced or unannounced, but they acknowledged that unannounced visits are currently very unusual. Desktop audits will increase, for example with automated checks with Companies House, and with HMRC’s records on salaries, to reduce bureaucracy, so sponsors can be audited without a physical site visit.\n\nLaunch of the UK ETA for visitors\n\nThe UK government is working towards an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for visa exempt visitors which will be introduced in 2023. The idea is to bring the UK in line with international partners such as the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand who have similar requirements for visitors.\n\nVisa exempt visitors who previously could visit the UK with nothing more than their passport will be required to obtain an ETA for their visit. It is important to note that this is not the same as a visa. The ETA will be used to increase the government’s knowledge of the activities of visitors, as well as track and prevent visitors overstaying in the UK illegally.\n\nEmployers need to assess the impact of the ETA roll out on their business traveller population and then communications should be sent to alert their employees seeking to travel to the UK of the upcoming requirement for an ETA. The associated costs have not yet been confirmed; however, it is expected to be in the region of £20 to keep in line with similar programmes.\n\nEU Covid/Teleworker update on social security rules\n\nEU/EFTA/Switzerland are reviewing the social security rules for a subset of cross border workers who qualify as “Teleworkers”. We are currently in a transitional period until 30 June 2023 – allowing individuals to continue to pay social security as normal, even if their working pattern has changed to work for more time in their home location (e.g. above the 25% current multi-state threshold). Employers are eagerly awaiting more guidance on the position post 30 June 2023 for both multi-state workers and teleworkers, taking into consideration new ways of working. We understand the final proposal will be discussed at the EU Commission at the end of March. Given HMRC has followed the EU guidance up until now it will be interesting to see if (and how) any changes will apply to the UK going forward.\n\nOECD looking at mobility issues\n\nMore welcome news – the OECD is looking at global mobility in 2023! The OECD is reviewing the difficulties global employers face when dealing with global mobility, particularly considering new ways of working. This is a very welcome development given employers are increasingly having to deal with remote workers, digital nomads, workcations and more, and grappling with how to apply current tax and treaty rules to these new types of workers.\n\nHMRC Joint Expatriate Tax Forum updates\n\nThere are a number of outstanding queries that have been raised to HMRC over the last few years, which HMRC has been reviewing. Direction of travel seems to be that HMRC will shortly be publishing more guidance on the following topics:\n\nOn the social security side, HMRC has just published the long awaited results of customer research (including Vialto Partners’ views) on social security processes – namely suggestions for improving the application experience. We are hopeful that this will yield real progress at HMRC in digitalising the process end to end. Whilst the report reflects on the differing user experiences and their exposure to using HMRC’s current online process, HMRC highlighted 5 key areas where the user experience could be enhanced. The pick of these 5 areas were digitising certificates – moving away from hard copy certificates, providing a detailed status tracker for applications – removing the requirement to call HMRCs call centre and incorporating an ‘auto-fill’ feature within the online application forms in an attempt to reduce the number of questions. The report was the first step to identify how and what improvements could be made. Our social security team remains front and centre for all future discussions to assist HMRC and our clients get more from the current online process.\n\nRecommended action\n\nDo reach out to your Vialto Partners contact (or any of the individuals linked below) to discuss any of the above updates in further detail or to provide feedback and suggestions for useful content.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "13 November 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nSwitzerland Vaud Canton – Stricter review of priority criteria in case of Swiss candidates in search efforts\n\nImpact High\n\nSwitzerland’s Dual System: A Quick Overview\nSwitzerland operates a dual system for granting foreign nationals access to its labor market. EU and EFTA citizens benefit from facilitated access under the Free Movement of Persons Agreement (between Switzerland and the EU), while individuals from other countries, known as ‘third states,’ can work in Switzerland provided they meet specific admission requirements outlined in the Foreign Nationals and Integration Act (FNIA). These requirements include for example personal qualifications (e.g. highly skilled workers profile), considerations of Switzerland’s economic interests a quota system as well as to the so called priority of local workers.\n\nAdjustments in the Application of Swiss Immigration Law by Canton of Vaud\nRecent updates in the application of Swiss immigration law by the Canton of Vaud is altering the rules governing the hiring of third-state nationals whereas search efforts are under stricter review. Employers are now required to put in extra efforts and provide detailed explanations to the authorities especially if Swiss citizens apply for a job and are not selected. This entails not only explaining why the hired third-state national is more suitable than other candidates but also justifying more precisely, and on top, why a Swiss citizen specifically could not be hired for the position.\n\nWhat this means\nIn conclusion, the recent adjustments in the practice from Vaud Canton have a direct impact on employers, particularly when hiring third-state nationals. With the increased focus on justifying the selection of third-state nationals over Swiss candidates, it is paramount to maintain meticulous records of their hiring processes.

        "title": "Germany | Employment Tax | Garden Leave—Taxation of wages in connection with the termination of an employment contract under the Annual Tax Act",
        "date": "June 26, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nGermany | Garden Leave – Taxation of wages in connection with the termination of an employment contract under the Annual Tax Act\n\nSummary\n\nThe Annual Tax Act 2024 is intended to avoid double taxation or non-taxation of wages granted for the period of a leave of absence until the termination of the employment contract. The new statutory regulation is based on the OECD model commentary but deviates from the Circular Letter of the German Ministry of Finance dated December 12, 2023. The new ruling is to be applied on the day after announcement.\n\nThe detail\n\nAccording to the Circular Letter of the German Ministry of Finance dated December 12, 2023 (BStBl. I p. 2179), a distinction is made in the taxation of wages in connection with garden leave payments prior to a termination of the employment relationship as to whether the leave of absence is a revocable or irrevocable one. In the case of a revocable leave of absence, the employee must remain available and therefore the “activity” is performed where the employee is present. In the case of an irrevocable leave of absence, on the other hand, the employee does not perform any work and the right of taxation is with the employee’s country of residence in accordance with Art. 15 para. 1 OECD-MA.\n\nThe OECD model commentary contains a view that differs from the Circular Letter. According to the model commentary, the salary that an employee receives for the leave of absence is to be taxed in the country in which the activity would have been carried out without the leave of absence. Many OECD countries apply double taxation agreements in accordance with the OECD Model Taxation Convention, which may result in white income or double taxation.\n\nWith the introduction of Section 50d para. 15 of the German Income Tax Act (EStG), the legislator has taken up the OECD Model Taxation Convention to counteract double taxation or non-taxation. If the applicable double taxation agreement or a consultation agreement (e.g., with Luxembourg or Switzerland) does not contain an explicit provision on the taxation of wages during the leave of absence, the place where the employee would have worked without the leave of absence is taken as the basis for the application of double tax treaties.\n\nA respective  regulation is created for employees with limited tax liability in Section 49 para. 1 no. 4 lit. f EStG. Income from employment was only subject to taxation in Germany in accordance with Section 49 para. 1 no. 4 lit. a EStG if it was exercised or utilized in Germany. Therefore, previously wages in connection with the leave of absence were regularly not subject to taxation in Germany, where there was no presence in Germany. Section 49 para. 1 no. 4 letter f EStG now ensure that wages during the exemption phase are also taxable in Germany according to national law.\n\nSection 50d para. 15 and Section 49 para. 1 no. 4 lit. f EStG are to be applied on the day after announcement.\n\nNote: These are only draft regulations. Changes could therefore still arise. The legislative process is not expected to be completed until the end of 2024.\n\n\n\nDeutschland | Garden Leave – Besteuerung von Arbeitslohn im Zusammenhang mit der Beendigung eines Arbeitsverhältnisses nach dem Jahressteuergesetz 2024\n\nZusammenfassung\n\nMit dem Jahressteuergesetz 2024 soll eine Doppel- oder Nichtbesteuerung von Arbeitslohn, der für die Zeit einer Arbeitsfreistellung bis zur Beendigung des Arbeitsverhältnisses gewährt wird, vermieden werden. Die gesetzliche Neuregelung erfolgt in Anlehnung an die OECD-Musterkommentierung, sieht jedoch eine vom BMF-Schreiben vom 12. Dezember 2023 abweichende Besteuerung vor, die bereits am Tag nach Verkündigung anzuwenden ist.\n\nDetails\n\nNach dem BMF-Schreiben vom 12. Dezember 2023 (BStBl. I S. 2179) wird bei der Besteuerung von Arbeitslohn im Zusammenhang mit der Beendigung des Arbeitsverhältnisses unterschieden, ob es sich um eine widerrufliche oder unwiderrufliche Arbeitsfreistellung handelt. Bei einer widerruflichen Freistellung muss sich der Arbeitnehmer zur Verfügung halten und daher wird die “Arbeitsleistung” dort erbracht, wo sich der Arbeitnehmer tatsächlich aufhält. Handelt es sich hingegen um eine unwiderrufliche Arbeitsfreistellung, so übt der Arbeitnehmer keine Tätigkeit aus und das Besteuerungsrecht liegt nach Art. 15 Abs. 1 OECD-MA beim Ansässigkeitsstaat des Arbeitnehmers.\n\nDer OECD-Musterkommentar beinhaltet eine vom BMF Schreiben abweichende Auffassung. Demzufolge ist der Arbeitslohn, den ein Arbeitnehmer für die Arbeitsfreistellung erhält, in dem Staat zu besteuern, in dem die Tätigkeit ohne Freistellung ausgeübt worden wäre. Eine Vielzahl der OECD-Staaten wenden Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen unter Berücksichtigung der OECD-Musterkommentierung an, weshalb es zu weißen Einkünften oder Doppelbesteuerungen kommen kann.\n\nMit der Einführung des § 50d Abs. 15 EStG greift der Gesetzgeber die OECD-Musterkommentierung auf, um der Doppel- oder Nichtbesteuerung entgegenzuwirken. Sollte das jeweilig anwendbare Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen oder eine Konsultationsvereinbarung (bspw. mit Luxemburg oder der Schweiz) keine ausdrückliche Regelung zur Besteuerung des Arbeitslohns während der Arbeitsfreistellung enthalten, so wird für die Zwecke der Anwendung des DBAs darauf abgestellt, wo der Arbeitnehmer die Tätigkeit ohne Freistellung ausgeübt hätte.\n\nFür beschränkt steuerpflichtige Arbeitnehmer wird mit § 49 Abs. 1 Nr. 4 Buchstabe f EStG eine entsprechende Regelung geschaffen. Einkünfte aus nichtselbständiger Tätigkeit unterlagen nach § 49 Abs. 1 Nr. 4 Buchstabe a EStG nur der Besteuerung in Deutschland, wenn sie im Inland ausgeübt oder verwertet wurden. Daher unterlag der Arbeitslohn im Zusammenhang mit der Arbeitsfreistellung bisher regelmäßig nicht der Besteuerung in Deutschland, wenn keine Anwesenheit in Deutschland bestand. § 49 Abs. 1 Nr. 4 Buchstabe f EStG stellt nun sicher, dass auch der Arbeitslohn während der Freistellungsphase in Deutschland nach nationalem Recht steuerpflichtig ist.\n\nDie § 50d Abs. 15 und § 49 Abs. 1 Nr. 4 Buchstabe f EStG sind am Tag nach der Verkündigung anzuwenden.\n\nHinweis: Hierbei handelt es sich lediglich um Regelungen im Entwurfsstadium. Es könnten sich demnach noch Änderungen ergeben. Das Gesetzgebungsverfahren wird erst in der zweiten Hälfte des Jahres 2024 abgeschlossen sein.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMathias Schmitt\nPartner\nSteuerberater\n\nDamaris Besenreuther\nSenior Manager\nSteuerberaterin\n\nSina Kunzweiler\nSenior Manager\nSteuerberaterin\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

Please look out for further emails from us on how to participate.\n\nThe MAC’s deadline to present its findings is May 2025.\n\nThe Detail\n\nWhen commissioning the MAC the new Government stated a belief that:\n\n“The current high levels of international recruitment reflect weaknesses in the labour market including persistent skills shortages in the UK”.\n\nIt also affirmed a commitment to “bring down the high levels of migration”.\n\nAccordingly, the MAC has been asked to look at key occupations to understand the reasons behind what the Government perceives to be a ‘reliance’ by employers on international recruitment in key sectors. IT and Engineering occupations have been selected first.\n\nEmployers must select a Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code when assigning a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) to a migrant worker they intend to sponsor. IT and Engineering SOC codes are used on a very high percentage of CoS and the government is keen to understand why.\n\nAs part of its new commission the MAC has been asked to look at:\n\nIn reaching its findings the MAC will work with the newly formed Skills England with its responsibility for identifying skills gaps across the labour market, the Industrial Strategy Council, plus input from DWP.\n\nFurther occupational groups are expected to be reviewed in due course.\n\nThe MAC has been given a deadline of 9 months (May 2025) to report back on the above questions. The MAC has yet to formally respond to its new commission, however, as part of the detailed research it will undertake, we expect significant stakeholder engagement.

        "title": "India | Employment Tax | Non-availability of tax residency certificate—Not a reason for denial of treaty benefit",
        "date": "April 26, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nNon-availability of tax residency certificate—Not a reason for denial of treaty benefit\n\nSummary\n\nTax Residency Certificate (‘TRC’) is an evidence which substantiates tax residency of a taxpayer in the country where he/she has rendered services for the claim of relief under the tax treaties. As per the Indian tax provisions, it requires an individual to report in the tax form at the time of filing Indian tax return whether they have obtained a TRC to claim tax relief under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) between India and various countries.\n\nRecently, Delhi Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (‘ITAT’) held (1) that TRC is not a prerequisite document if the same is not available at the time of filing tax return. A taxpayer should obtain the TRC while claiming treaty benefit as it may be required later during the assessment proceeding.\n\n(1) Yogesh Kotiyal [TS-254-ITAT-2024(DEL)]\n\nThe detail\n\nBackground of the case\n\nDuring the Assessment Year (‘AY’) 2020-21, an assessee went on an overseas assignment to Australia, and he continued to receive salary income in India against the services rendered for the Australian entity. The assessee qualified to be a Non-Resident in India and a Resident in Australia for the relevant AY. He filed a revised India tax return to claim the treaty benefit under the India-Australia DTAA.\n\nIssues in the case\n\nThe Assessing Officer (‘AO’) initiated scrutiny assessment proceeding to verify the claim raised by the assessee. The assessee submitted the Australia tax return for the year 2018 and 2019 as an evidence for his Australian residency and proof of payment of the taxes. The AO disallowed the claim on the grounds that the assessee didn’t submit the TRC. The assessee filed an objection before the Dispute Resolution Panel (‘DRP’). However, the objection got rejected on the following grounds:\n\ni. The assessee had an employer-employee relationship with the Indian entity while working for the Australian entity.\nii. The assessee has not shown that taxes have been paid in Australia.\niii. The assessee failed to submit TRC at the time of scrutiny proceeding.\n\nITAT’s comments\n\nAggrieved by the assessment order, the assessee filed an appeal before the ITAT. The ITAT noted the following:\n\ni. The assessee provided various supporting’s like assignment agreement, passport, Australia tax return, in support of his claim.\nii. An application for admission of TRC as an additional evidence was filed before the DRP but the same was not considered.\niii. The Tax Authorities denied the exemption as TRC was not furnished but ignored the fact that Australia tax return was submitted as an alternate evidence.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Assessee did not have any workday in India during the relevant AY. On reading section 5, 9 and 15 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, taxability did not arise in India on the salary/allowances received by the assessee since the assessee was a non-resident and had rendered services outside India. Thus, the salary income earned for rendering services outside India could not be taxed in India. Hence, the assessee was eligible to claim exemption under Article 15(1) of the India- Australia DTAA even though TRC was not available at the time of filing the tax return.\n\nWhile each individual’s situation should be looked at fact specific, the ruling would have a persuasive value in situation where you do not have the TRC but have sufficient evidence to claim the treaty relief in your tax return.\n\nContact us:\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nRavi Jain \nPartner\n\nSanthosh S \nDirector\n\nSanjay Yadav \nManager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "May 24, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nGermany | Tax treatment of child allowance paid to the employer as part of a net salary agreement\n\nSummary\n\nIf an employee assigns their child benefit to their employer on the basis of a net salary agreement, the child benefit paid to the employer reduces the employee’s gross salary at the time of payment. In its ruling of February 8, 2024 – VI R 26/21, the Federal Fiscal Court (BFH) ruled that child benefit assigned and paid to the employer as part of a net salary agreement is to be treated as a tax refund and constitutes negative wages at the time of receipt.\n\nThe detail\n\nThe claimant was assigned to Germany by his Japanese employer from October 2017 to August 2019. His family (spouse and two children) accompanied him during the assignment. As part of a net salary agreement, the claimant agreed that the child benefit would be paid to the German employer.\n\nIn his income tax return, the claimant considered the child benefit as a reduction in his gross salary.\n\nThe tax office rejected the reduction on the basis that the child benefit is not considered as remuneration for work performed, but as a tax allowance.\n\nThe decision of the Federal fiscal court (BFH)\n\nOn February 8, 2024 – VI R 26/21, the BFH ruled that the child benefit paid to the employer reduces the employee’s\ngross salary. The BFH justified this as follows:\n\nA net wage agreement exists if the employer undertakes, on the basis of the employment contract or company agreement, to pay the deductions owed (wage tax, church tax, solidarity surcharge and, if applicable, the employee’s share of social insurance) in addition to the net wage. The net wage for the respective wage payment period must be extrapolated to a gross wage. Once the gross wage is determined, wage taxes are calculated. Reducing the gross wage by the employer funded deductions results in the net amount.\n\nIf the employer pays income tax arrears for the employee in accordance with their personal tax assessment notice, this constitutes an inflow of additional wages at the time of payment. The payment taken over must be extrapolated to a gross amount as detailed above. If the employer receives a tax refund resulting from the employee’s personal tax assessment notice, the refund must be taken into account in the wage payment period of the inflow to reduce income, as at this time the employee’s actual income has flowed back to the employer in accordance with Section 11 para. 1 sentence 1 of the Income Tax Act (EStG).\n\nThe equalization of family benefits in accordance with Section 31 EStG results in the tax exemption of an amount of income equal to the minimum subsistence level of a child This is achieved either by granting the child allowance in accordance with § 32 Para. 6 EStG or by paying the child benefit. As part of the personal tax filing process, an analysis is performed to identify which method is more favorable for the employee. If the child allowance leads to a lower tax liability, the monthly child benefit paid is added to the income tax. The monthly child benefit payment can therefore be regarded as a prepayment for possible income tax relief, as the child benefit has a direct effect on the amount of the tax refund claim. If not only the income refund but also the child benefit is assigned as part of a net salary agreement to the employer, the assigned payments must be taken into account at the time of receipt by deducting them from the current salary.\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nGermany | Steuerliche Behandlung des an den Arbeitgeber abgetretenen Kindergeldes im Rahmen einer Nettolohnvereinbarung\n\nZusammenfassung\n\nTritt der Arbeitnehmer aufgrund einer Nettolohnvereinbarung das Kindergeld an seinen Arbeitgeber ab, so mindert das an den Arbeitgeber gezahlte Kindergeld den Bruttoarbeitslohn des Arbeitnehmers im Zeitpunkt der Zahlung. Der Bundesfinanzhof (BFH) entschied in seinem Urteil vom 8. Februar 2024 – VI R 26/21, dass im Rahmen einer Nettolohnvereinbarung an den Arbeitgeber abgetretene und gezahlte Kindergeld wie Steuererstattungen zu behandeln ist und negativen Arbeitslohn im Zuflusszeitpunkt darstellen.\n\nIm Detail\n\nDer Kläger war zusammen mit seiner Ehefrau und den zwei Kindern von Oktober 2017 bis August 2019 von seinem japanischen Arbeitgeber nach Deutschland entsandt worden. Im Rahmen einer Nettolohnvereinbarung erklärte sich der Kläger damit einverstanden, dass das Kindergeld an den deutschen Arbeitgeber, eine GmbH, ausgezahlt wird.\n\nIm Rahmen seiner Einkommensteuererklärung berücksichtigte der Kläger das abgetretene Kindergeld als Minderung des Bruttoarbeitslohnes.\n\nDas Finanzamt lehnte die Kürzung ab. Kindergeld sei kein Entgelt für geleistete Arbeit, sondern eine Steuervergütung.\n\nDie Entscheidung des BFH\n\nDer BFH entschied am 8. Februar 2024 – VI R 26/21, dass das an den Arbeitgeber abgetretene und gezahlte Kindergeld den Bruttoarbeitslohn des Arbeitnehmers mindert. Dies begründete der BFH wie folgt:\n\nEine Nettolohnvereinbarung liegt dann vor, wenn sich der Arbeitgeber aufgrund des Arbeitsvertrages oder Betriebsvereinbarung verpflichtet, zusätzlich zu dem Nettolohn auch die geschuldeten Abzugsbeträge (Lohnsteuer, Kirchensteuer, Solidaritätszuschlag und ggf. den Arbeitnehmeranteil zur Sozialversicherung) zu übernehmen. Der Nettolohn des jeweiligen Lohnzahlungszeitraums ist auf einen Bruttolohn hochzurechnen. Die Lohnsteuer ist aus dem Bruttoarbeitslohn zu berechnen, der nach Minderung um die übernommenen Abzugsbeträge den Nettobetrag ergibt.\n\nÜbernimmt der Arbeitgeber die Einkommensteuernachzahlung gemäß dem Steuerbescheid für den Arbeitnehmer, so\nhandelt es sich im Zeitpunkt der Zahlung um Zufluss von weiterem Arbeitslohn. Die übernommene Zahlung ist auf einen Bruttobetrag hochzurechnen. Erhält der Arbeitgeber die aus dem Steuerbescheid resultierende Steuererstattung, so ist die Erstattung im Lohnzahlungszeitraum des Zuflusses  einkunftsmindernd zu berücksichtigen, da zu diesem Zeitpunkt tatsächliche Einnahmen des Arbeitnehmers nach § 11 Abs. 1 S. 1 Einkommensteuergesetz (EStG) an den Arbeitgeber zurückgeflossen sind.\n\nDer Familienleistungsausgleich nach § 31 EStG bewirkt die steuerliche Freistellung eines Einkommensbetrags in Höhe des Existenzminimums eines Kindes einschließlich der Bedarfe für Betreuung und Erziehung oder Ausbildung. Dies erfolgt entweder durch Gewährung des Kinderfreibetrages nach § 32 Abs. 6 EStG oder durch Zahlung des Kindergeldes. Im Rahmen der Veranlagung wird überprüft, was für den Arbeitnehmer steuerlich günstiger ist. Sofern der Kinderfreibetrag zu einer niedrigeren Steuerschuld führt, wird das monatliche gezahlte Kindergeld zur tariflichen Einkommensteuer hinzugerechnet. Die monatliche Kindergeldzahlung kann somit als Vorauszahlung auf eine mögliche einkommensteuerrechtliche Kinderentlastung angesehen werden, denn das Kindergeld wirkt sich unmittelbar auf die Höhe des Steuererstattungsanspruchs aus. Wird im Rahmen einer Nettolohnvereinbarung nicht nur die Einkommenserstattung sondern auch das Kindergeld abgetreten, so sind die abgetretenen Zahlungen im Zeitpunkt des Zuflusses durch den Abzug vom laufenden Arbeitslohn zu berücksichtigen.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMathias Schmitt\nPartner\n\nDamaris Besenreuther\nSenior Manager\n\nAleksandra Amedov\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "October 11, 2023",
        "content": "11 October 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nSummary\n\nIn the dynamic landscape of Swiss immigration, the concept of a company’s ‘substance’ is the linchpin that can either open doors or trigger alarm bells. But why should this matter to you as a client?\n\nImagine this: You’re a foreign company eyeing the Swiss market, or you’re an individual seeking to work and live in Switzerland. It all seems promising, especially under the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons (AFMP) between Switzerland and the European Union, which grants EU nationals the right to reside and work in Switzerland with a local employment contract in hand.\n\nHowever, recent times have witnessed a shift in the winds of immigration scrutiny, particularly in the construction sector, sparked by the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. Authorities are now peering closely into the ‘substance’ of companies operating in Switzerland. This term, ‘substance,’ encompasses a company’s physical presence, its genuine economic activities, and its contribution to the Swiss employment landscape.\n\nWhy is ‘substance’ a critical factor, you ask? It’s the litmus test for determining whether a company qualifies as ‘Swiss-based’ under the AFMP, affecting not only the company but also its employees and even its clients.\n\nThe risks are real and looming. If your company is found lacking in ‘substance,’ it could face permit revocations, immediate work halts, and employee expulsions, with potential legal repercussions. The financial consequences and damage to your reputation could be staggering.\n\nBut fret not, there are solutions on the horizon. In the short term, classifying employees as ‘posted workers’ can help maintain business continuity, albeit with added complexities. In the long term, building ‘substance’ for your Swiss-based company is the path to stability, though it requires strategic planning and investment.\n\nIn conclusion, Swiss immigration law’s ‘substance of a company’ is no mere technicality. It’s the fulcrum upon which your Swiss ventures pivot. To navigate this complex terrain and safeguard your interests, professional guidance is indispensable. Your business success and peace of mind in Switzerland depend on it.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn Swiss immigration law, the term “substance of a company” refers to the physical presence and genuine economic activity of a company in Switzerland. The concept of substance is important in determining whether a foreign company or foreign employees of a company are eligible to work and reside in Switzerland under the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons (AFMP) between Switzerland and the European Union.\n\nBased on the AFMP, EU nationals have the legal right to take up residence and work in Switzerland, provided they sign a local (Swiss) employment contract with a Swiss based company.\n\nRecent developments\n\nWhile the AFMP allows the work and residence of EU nationals in Switzerland, provided they sign a local employment contract, the authorities have been rather lenient with accepting signed employment contracts without further diligence on the employer substance or setup in Switzerland.\n\nSince the Covid-19 pandemic we have noticed an increase in scrutiny by the labor market and migration authorities, whereby they are checking in detail if a company has a real presence in Switzerland or not. We have noticed this increased scrutiny especially in the construction / construction services sector and have since experienced crack-downs in this area.\n\nThe problem of substance\n\nIt is possible that companies based in the EU/EFTA have established a branch office (or even just a letterbox company) in Switzerland for the provision of services in Switzerland. In this case, the competent cantonal authority must verify whether the Swiss-based company has the necessary infrastructure (“substance”) that indicates that the reported activity is actually being carried out by this company. If this is not the case, employing non-Swiss employees will not be considered as local hiring under Article 6 of Annex I AFMP, but possibly as a posting/ secondment under Article 5 AFMP.\n\nWhen assessing the substance of a company, immigration authorities consider various factors, including:\n\nThe assessment of substance is typically carried out by immigration authorities on a case-by-case basis. So far the assessment has consisted of retrospective controls (in some cases 6 -12 months after the original hire date of the employee) via ad hoc inspections on site (company branch)  or at customer premises.\n\nLack of substance\n\nIt must be emphasized again that the authorities do not determine if a company / branch in Switzerland has been “legally” established (i.e. entry into the commercial registry etc.). Instead the migration authorities are determining if this legally established company / branch has sufficient substance to be considered a “Swiss-based company” for the purpose of employing (foreign) employees on local contracts.\n\nShould the migration authorities come to the conclusion that insufficient substance is provided by the company / branch, then they will revisit the permit status of all the registered employees (“retrospective inspection”) of that company and possibly cancel their work and residence permits immediately and provide a fixed date until when the employees must leave the country. Usually the authorities order an immediate stop / prohibition of work from the date of issuance of this decision. Appeals to this decision will not remove the “immediate stop of work”.\n\nGeneral risk\n\nBased on the above elaborations, the risk for an immediate “stop of work” is genuine and concrete. While monetary penalties and fines might seem low compared to a potential service order and might as such be considered “acceptable risk” when providing services in Switzerland by foreign companies, the potential loss of profit because no further work can be provided (due to an immediate halt of services) in Switzerland will be vastly greater.\n\nEven more, the risk is not limited to the service providing company, but also to the commissioning company. The commissioning company (i.e. the client) and its board of directors might be held liable for contractors- or subcontractors without adequate labor authority and migration authority permissions. We’ve experienced that members of the board of directors have been interviewed by the police.\n\nBased on the potential risk of breach, we recommend taking utmost care in this setup in Switzerland as the reputational and economic damage to a service provider can be immense if handled incorrectly.\n\nPossible solutions\n\nThere are two solutions to the above mentioned situation, one for a short term fix and the other one with an eye to the long term should authorities challenge the situation:\n\nConclusion\n\nIn Swiss immigration law, the concept of “substance of a company” determines eligibility for foreign companies to have foreign employees work in Switzerland. Recent developments have increased scrutiny by authorities on the physical presence and genuine economic activity of companies, particularly in the construction sector.\n\nFailure to meet requirements may result in employees being classified as posted workers instead of local hires. Factors considered in assessing substance include physical presence, economic activity, job creation, financial viability, and compliance with regulations (see above). Consulting legal professionals is crucial for compliance and navigating the immigration process. Insufficient substance can lead to permit revocation, immediate work cessation, and employee departure. The risk is significant for service providers and commissioning companies, potentially holding their directors liable and also for the employees themselves who might feel that the company is sending them to Switzerland illegally, hence creating uncertainty and chaos.\n\nPossible solutions include classifying employees as posted workers in the short term, or creating substance for the Swiss-based company or branch in the long term. Careful attention is necessary to avoid reputational and economic damage.\n\nWhen dealing with immigration law in Switzerland mitigating risks, ensuring compliance, and seeking professional advice are essential to protect interests and one’s business when operating in Switzerland.\n\nPlease reach out to us if you would like further information and guidance on this very important immigration topic.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAra Samuelian\nPartner, Europe and Swiss Immigration Lead\nara.samuelian@vialto.com\n\nRobert Arnaud\nSenior Associate\nrobert.b.arnaud@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com",

        "content": "Immigration\n\nSaudi Arabia | New education visa scheme\n\nSummary \nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has recently introduced an exciting new educational visa program aimed at attracting foreign students. This initiative is part of Saudi Arabia’s broader strategy to increase the number of international students choosing to study in the country.\n\nThe Detail \nThe Saudi Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have confirmed that this program was launched during the ‘Human Capacity Initiative’ conference.\n\nUnder this new visa scheme, foreign students from various countries will now have the opportunity to apply for a KSA student visa without the need for a sponsor within the country. This change simplifies the visa application process and makes studying in KSA more accessible for international students.\n\nThe introduction of this student visa scheme reflects Saudi Arabia’s commitment to enhancing its educational landscape and promoting international collaboration. By removing the requirement for a sponsor, the country aims to streamline the visa process and attract a greater number of foreign students to study in the country. The development seeks to recognise the value that international students bring to its academic community and acknowledges the importance of providing them with opportunities to pursue their educational goals in Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhat this means\nWhile the program has been announced, it is important to note that the details regarding the application process and the specific requirements are yet to be announced by the authorities. The implementation of the service is also pending. The Saudi authorities are currently working on finalising the necessary procedures and documentation to ensure a smooth and efficient application process for interested students.\n\nProspective applicants are advised to stay updated with the official announcements from the Saudi Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the application process and requirements. Once the program is fully implemented it is expected that comprehensive guidelines and instructions will be provided on how to submit the application and the specific documents needed.\n\nIn the meantime, interested students can start preparing by gathering the necessary documents typically required for student visa applications, such as proof of enrollment in an educational institution, academic transcripts, a valid passport, and financial documents to demonstrate the ability to cover tuition fees and living expenses.\n\nHow we can help \nWe are closely monitoring these changes in Saudi Arabia, and can advise you with respect to the impact of those changes.\n\nContact us \nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnir Chatterji\nEMEA Immigration Partner\n\nAli Ibrahim\nDirector, Middle East Immigration\n\nAhmed Amer\nManager, Middle East Immigration\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nContact us on the following address – me-immigration@vialto.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Germany | Immigration | New immigration law drafted",
        "date": "January 16, 2023",
        "content": "11 January 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nImpact High\n\nSummary\n\nA new draft law concerns the introduction of a points system to allow skilled workers to stay in Germany for up to one year to look for a job.\n\nFurthermore, it is planned to waive the requirement for a connection between training and the job as a prerequisite for the issuance of an EU Blue Card. A reduction of certain salary thresholds is implemented in the draft as well.\n\nThe quota for the so-called Western Balkans regulation will increase 100% and the expiration date of the regulation is cancelled.\n\nThe draft is expected to be implemented before the end of the first half of 2023.\n\nThe Detail\n\nGermany is planning to make it easier for foreign skilled workers to enter the country to take up employment.\n\nCurrently the job seeker visa is only available for academic skilled workers.\n\nThe government plans to introduce a points system for professionally or academically educated foreign skilled workers, seeking for employment in Germany. The distribution of points for the so-called Opportunity Card (“Chancenkarte”), i.e., a visa to search for a job, is planned as follows:\n\nDegree Recognition\n– 6 points if the degree is already fully recognized in Germany\n– 4 points if the degree is partially recognized and just an adjustment is needed\n\nWork experience\n– 3 points for at least three years of work experience\n– 2 points for at least two years of work experience\n\nGerman language skills\n– 3 points for knowledge at the level of at least B2\n– 2 point for knowledge at the level of at least B1\n\nAge\n– 2 points for skilled workers aged 35 or below\n– 1 point for skilled workers aged 40 or below\n\nReference to Germany\n– 1 point for at least 6 months legal residence in Germany during the last 5 years\n– 1 point if a sponsor agrees to support integration into the labour market and the German society.\n\nTo qualify for the Opportunity Card, applicants must have a foreign degree and score at least 6 points in the above categories. The Opportunity Card is valid for up to one year and allows trial employment for up to 20 hours per week in a maximum period of 2 weeks.\n\nAs announced in our previous alert on 9th of December, it is planned that a skilled worker with an education recognized by the German authorities will in principle be allowed to work in any non-regulated profession in the future. For example, an economist could work as an IT specialist. The minimum salary thresholds required for the EU Blue Card will be lowered. This will apply to IT specialists as well. For them, the requirements for language skills will also be reduced.\n\nFinally, the German government wants to abolish the time limit of the so-called Western Balkans regulation. Nationals from Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, the Republic of Northern Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia have been able to come to Germany to work, even without proof of formal qualifications, if they have a corresponding job offer. The regulation was originally to expire at the end of this year. In addition, the annual quota will increase from 25,000 to 50,000 individuals.\n\nWhat this means\n\nFor employers, this mainly means that candidates will most likely be already in the country when they want to hire them and will not have to go through the visa process in their home countries. Furthermore, the introduction of the law will give workers a great opportunity to apply for an EU Blue Card without having to explain in detail how their new job fits with the degree. The latter has led to challenges in many cases in the past.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe will monitor the situation closely and will reach out to our clients as soon as the planned changes are implemented. To guarantee a clear and efficient processes, we keep our clients updated throughout the\nupcoming legislative procedure.\n\nWe can assist you, your employees, and candidates as well as their family members with their relocation to Germany and determine how the upcoming changes can help you and them to smoothly navigating through the German immigration system.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n• Mostafa Massoud, Rechtsanwalt (Lawyer) | mostafa.massoud@vialto.com\n• Inga Mayer, Rechtsanwältin (Lawyer) | inga.m.mayer@vialto.com\n• Eva Witt, Rechtsanwältin (Lawyer) | eva.witt@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "France | Social Security | French Social Security Liability On Deferred Compensation",
        "date": "February 23, 2023",
        "content": "20 February 2023\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nWhere a payment is made after the person has changed States of social security registration, a potential conflict of social security jurisdictions must be resolved since no sourcing rule is expressly stated in French social security laws.\n\n▪ In the absence of a statute that treats cross-jurisdictional situations, the French social security authorities’ habitual position is that social security contributions are due in the State where the employee is affiliated when she/he receives the payment (date of payment approach), regardless of the activity at the source of the income. As a result, using a sourcing approach to determine social security liability in a cross-border situation could be rejected by the French social security authorities.\n\nThis may cause situations where double social security contributions would be due in two different countries whereby the other country involved would apportion local social security contributions on the portion of the remuneration related to the activity pursued in that country. This conflict was highlighted in our earlier insight (19 October 2021 Apportionment Insight).\n\n▪ However, the above position is mitigated by recent rulings obtained by Vialto in France from the URSSAF (French social security taxes recovery fund) concerning non-qualified equity plans (RSU and Stock-Option) plans as well as long term incentive cash plan (bonuses).\n\nOne of the rulings was rendered in the context of RSUs to an employee who was employed subsequently in the UK and in the USA at the award dates and then who was transferred and localized to France during the vesting period where he was subject to the French social security scheme at the payment date (the plan was not qualified from a French perspective and hence qualified as salary in France).\n\nURSSAF ruled out that a sourcing approach could be applied by the company and that the acquisition gain could be considered as being relating to 3 distinct periods (UK, US and France) so that French social security contributions should be due only on the portion of the gain related to the activity pursued in France.\n\nThis sourcing approach, whereby only the French source of the deferred compensation should be subject to French social security contributions, is nevertheless subject to three cumulative conditions:\n\n1. The individual is subject to the French social security scheme at the time of payment\n\n2. The foreign portion of the deferred income is subject to social security contributions in the other country.\n\n3. The foreign portion of the deferred income is ultimately borne by the foreign entity (even through reinvoicing).\n\nThe takeaway\n\nRulings are nominative in France and do engage the administration neither outside the specific case submitted to the authorities nor to third parties. Social security rulings cannot be deemed as binding outside the cases in question. However, they may be an indication of a change of the French authorities’ position. No official guidelines have been published yet by the French social security administration confirming the application of the sourcing approach position from a social security perspective for all deferred compensation. Vialto in France is currently on the process of asking clarifications, on a more general way, to the French administration concerning the social security treatment of cross-border payment situations. We will, of course, keep you informed.\n\nIn the meanwhile, it should be reminded that without such a ruling, URSSAF remains free to apply another position (and historically it was a date of payment approach, not a sourcing approach). Therefore, the sole way for a company to secure the sourcing position for its employees is to file a ruling (one ruling for the company, no need to file a ruling for each individual scenario). The response will be binding for the administration.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe notice that allocation of deferred compensation especially equity incomes based on activity in multiple jurisdictions is usually performed by companies only at the personal income tax level in France. However, as set forth above, there may be also an opportunity for companies to apply a sourcing approach for social security taxes. Experts at Vialto in France will also be able to provide you with further guidance on whether such apportionment may be contemplated in your situation, and if so, how to secure this position with the French social security authorities and implement it through payroll.\n\nContact us\n\nPlease reach out to your Vialto social security team in France to discuss further: Arzhvaël Le Fur and Morgane Texier.\n\nAlso, please feel free to reach out to the Vialto Partners Social Security Leadership team:\n● Adam Rewucha and Wendy Toonen, Northern European Social Security Lead\n● Natalia Graf and Morgane Texier, Western and Southern European Social Security Leads\n● Barbara Kolimeczkow, Eastern European Social Security Lead\n● Gary Chandler, UK and Ireland Social Security Lead\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "October 18, 2023",
        "content": "17 October 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nImpact High\n\nSummary\n\nOn Sunday 15 October, the Polish electorate went to the polls to cast votes in the parliamentary election. Final vote counts announced on Tuesday 17 October determined that Poland’s opposition parties won enough seats to take power from the Law and Justice Party (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość “PiS”) which has been in power since 2015.\n\nWhat might this mean for immigration policy going forward? Our immigration team in Poland shares initial thoughts on the potential impact below.\n\nDetails\n\nAlthough there is no coherent migration program proposed, it is an important topic for the winning parties. The general statements indicate that the migration policy will depend on Poland’s economic needs, but no mechanism has been revealed yet. It has been underlined that Ukrainian citizens helped entrepreneurs fill the gap in the labour market. The attention will most likely be directed to processes related to granting the visas, ensuring safety and implementing proper control measures over the border of a Polish territory would most likely be the priorities of the new government.\n\nTaking into account the announcements of the liberal and EU oriented parties that actually won the Polish elections and will probably rule in Poland for the coming years, we can expect Poland to open up and facilitate the employment of highly qualified foreigners in Poland.\n\nBut, due to the concerns raised during the election campaign regarding issues with Poland’s granting visas to third-country nationals, the Polish authorities will now be strongly focused on introducing objective algorithms allowing for the verification of foreigners wishing to enter Poland and implementing security measures.\n\nIn practice, it may enforce greater care in preparing complete applications and additional documents supporting a justified stay in Poland. This will require a lot of attention to detail. A more comprehensive approach to tax and immigration compliance is also expected (we hear about an introduction of an online platform for the exchange and monitoring of information regarding immigration, tax, labour law and social security statuses of foreigners).\n\nWhat this means\n\nTo summarise, we expect that the immigration policy will respond to the needs of the Polish entrepreneurs towards the labour market (with a strong demand on highly qualified workforce), but due to security issues, more attention will potentially be paid to proper and very detailed compliance enforcing employment of foreign nationals being managed by the immigration specialists.\n\nOur immigration team in Poland and advisory team continue to monitor the impact of the elections on immigration policy closely.

        "title": "Finland | Immigration | Changes to the Finnish Aliens Act",
        "date": "February 23, 2023",
        "content": "23 February 2023\n\n\n\nFinland | Immigration | Changes to the Finnish Aliens Act\n\n\n\nMedium Impact\n\nSummary\n\nThe Government of Prime Minister Sanna Marin has taken a series of actions in order to expedite the processing of work-based residence permit applications, including introducing the fast track processing option for specialists last summer. A number of additional changes to the Finnish Aliens Act are now being introduced in order to make the immigration process even smoother. The most recent amendments came into force on 23 February 2023 and include changes to the residence permit application process and immigration document storage requirements as well as a new employer certification option.\n\nThe Detail\n\nThe Government has put a lot of effort into shortening the processing times of work-based residence permit applications significantly and making the immigration processes smoother. The most significant change was the introduction of the fast track option for specialists in June 2022, which guarantees a decision within fourteen days from the day when the application is filed for individuals qualifying as specialists. Our initial experiences from the fast track option have been very positive, as most individuals have received a decision within one week of filing their application.\n\nIn order to further improve the processing of work-based residence permit applications and speed up the processing, various changes have been introduced to the Finnish Aliens Acts as of February 23, 2023. The most significant changes include:\n\nA new employer certification option is introduced\n\nEmployers are now able to apply for an employer certification. The purpose of the certification is to identify reliable employers and speed up the permit processing for their new hires by reducing the need for separate investigation with each application.The employer certification is voluntary but it is expected to be beneficial for employers, who have a substantial number of international hires. The certification is granted based upon application and the criteria include e.g. financial factors. It is also required that the Finnish Immigration Service has previously granted residence permits based on employment with the employer in question.\n\nEmployers are required to confirm the employment terms as part of the residence permit application process\n\nGoing forward, employers need to confirm the terms of employment using the Finnish Immigration Service’s online portal before the application processing starts. This was already required for the fast track option but the requirement is now extended to other work-based residence permit categories. Employers may authorise service providers to handle the actions on their behalf and there is a paper form option to use if online filing is not available.\n\nClarifications to the wording of the specialist exemption under article 81 b §\n\nThe wording of the 90 days exemption, which enables qualifying specialists to work in Finland without a residence permit, has been updated. The new wording specifies that the exemption is available to qualifying specialists for up to 90 days in any 180 day period.\n\nRequirement to store immigration documents reduced to two years from the employment end date\n\nFinnish employers are required to store information on the grounds for their foreign employees’ right to work throughout the duration of the employment as well as after the employment has ended. On February 23, this requirement to store information was reduced from four to two years from the employment end date.\n\nPossibility to issue a temporary employer-specific ban on new residence permit application approvals\n\nWhile the majority of the changes are looking to speed up and simplify the immigration procedures, additional efforts are also put into preventing labour exploitation. According to the new wording, the Finnish Immigration Service or TE Services is able to issue a temporary employer-specific ban of 3 – 12 months, during which work-based residence permit applications for the employer in question will be rejected.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe advise on various Finnish immigration matters, including residence permit applications under the fast track option for specialists and employer certification applications. We also help employers in confirming eligibility for the 90-day specialist exemption.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "UAE | Immigration |  Employment Contract Duration – Update",
        "date": "January 24, 2023",
        "content": "24 January 2023\n\nImpact High\n\nSummary\n\nIn line with the UAE’s new labour law which came into force in February 2022, all indefinite contracts had to be changed into fixed term agreements of a duration of up to three years. The three year cap was then lifted and parties have the freedom to opt for any contract duration as long as it specifies a definite term.\n\nThe Detail\n\nIn October 2022 the UAE’s Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE) provided greater flexibility by taking away the limit on the duration of labour contracts. Employers have had a ‘grace period’\nfrom February 2022 to 1 February 2023 to amend indefinite employment contracts to limited term contracts. The UAE Government has addressed concerns from both employee and employer’s side by removing the cap of three years on fixed-term employment agreements. It now allows both parties to stipulate any term duration agreeable by employee and employer, with the objective of protecting the rights of both parties and increasing the stability of the labour market.\n\nWhat this means\n\nIndefinite contracts should be changed to fixed-term agreements by 1 February 2023. The current Labour Law stipulates that all companies in the UAE that follow mainland labour law must transition their employees onto fixed term contracts.\n\nUAE Mainland – Unlimited contracts will need to be amended to contracts of a fixed duration by way of a ‘Labour contract amendment’ request submitted to the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation\n(MOHRE) before the deadline of 1 February 2023.\n\nUAE Free Zone – Companies incorporated in the Freezone (except DIFC and ADGM) will also need to comply with the new labour law, however, most Freezones have stipulated that companies are not required to notify the concerned Freezone authorities of the contract amendment. The new contract duration can be mutually agreed internally between parties unless there are any changes to the employee’s basic salary. In this case an amendment to the salary would need to be submitted to the relevant Freezone authorities in order for the changes to be reflected on the employee’s records.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe will continue to closely monitor and provide timely guidance on any new updates by the UAE\nImmigration and Labour authorities, and highlight the impact of any changes to your expatriate workforce.\n\nContact us\n\nShould you have further questions on this update, please reach out to:\n\n● Anir Chatterji – Partner, EMEA Immigration: anir.chatterji@vialto.com\n● Rekha Simpson – Director, Middle East Immigration: rekha.simpson@vialto.com\n● Dounia Fathi-Benbrahim – Senior Manager, Middle East Immigration: dounia.fathi-benbrahim@vialto.com\n● Ananth Prasad – Manager, Middle East Immigration: ananth.prasad@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "April 1, 2025",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nIn order to address labor market shortages, Luxembourg’s ADEM employment agency has updated the list of shortage occupations. For occupations included in this list, employers will be exempt from the labor market test when applying for work authorization. The new list contains 22 occupations compared to 24 in the previous list.\n\nThe detail\n\nOn Monday, 31 March 2025, the ADEM employment agency announced the publication of Luxembourg’s 2025 shortage occupation list. This list has been published in the Official Journal (Journal Officiel du Grand-Duché de Luxembourg) and is also available on the ADEM website.\n\nThis list identifies the most in-demand jobs for which very few or no suitable candidates are available through ADEM. Luxembourg is currently experiencing a significant shortage of qualified professionals in 22 specific job sectors (compared to 24 last year), including finance, banking, industrial and engineering, healthcare and social work, legal and compliance, IT, transport, automotive and business and management.\n\nTo ensure the shortage occupation list accurately reflects labor market needs, it is essential for employers to declare all vacant positions to ADEM. This list also serves to analyze the qualifications and skills required by employers and helps organize targeted training courses for jobseekers in the identified professions.\n\nWhat this means\n\nEmployers can apply for a foreign workforce (main-d’œuvre étrangère) certificate either when declaring a vacant position to ADEM or at any time during the validity period of the job posting. If the declared position corresponds to a profession on the shortage occupation list, ADEM will issue the certificate within five working days following acknowledgment of receipt.\n\nFor jobs not on the shortage occupation list, the market test will still apply but with reduced processing times. ADEM will have seven working days to verify whether suitable jobseekers are available for the declared position. If no candidates are found, the certificate will be issued within the next five working days. If ADEM identifies potential candidates, they will have an additional 15 working days to propose them to the employer.\n\nRecommended action\n\nEmployers recruiting third-country nationals should review the updated shortage occupation list. If a job is listed, hiring may be facilitated through exemption from the labor market test and potential eligibility for an EU Blue Card.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMaud Aupetit\nSenior Manager\n\nRebecca Serval\nSenior Associate\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "title": "Hungary | Employment Tax | 2024 tax law changes affecting individuals and employers",
        "date": "December 8, 2023",
        "content": "22 November 2023\n\nThe 2024 tax law changes has been approved by the Hungarian Parliament. The ’tax package’ contains a number of amendments that affect personal income taxation, social security contributions and social tax rules. We summarized the most important changes below.\n\nPersonal income tax\n\nSince the USA-Hungary Double Tax Treaty (’US-HU DTT’) will not be applicable as of 1 January 2024, many sections of the Act on Personal Income Tax (’PIT Act’) will be amended.\n\nThe rules on crediting personal income tax paid abroad is significantly modified, taking into account the interests of the Hungarian State Budget. The tax paid abroad can only be credited against the Hungarian personal income tax if the income is sourced from abroad (i.e. the place of earning is abroad). The sourcing, and thus the place of earning, must be established based on the relevant rules of the PIT Act. Previously, there was no such a prelimary condition for foreign tax crediting. The change was primarily implied by the termination of the US-HU DTT, but it is applicable to all cases where Hungary does not have a double tax treaty. This change affects the taxation of income both from activities and capital. In some cases, the amended rule may cause double taxation, i.e. posing a tax disadvantage for private individuals.\n\nThe tax regulation concerning artists and sportsmen performing in Hungary will be amended. Based on the modified regulation, their income will be taxable in Hungary even if the income is not paid directly to the individual, but to another person (e.g. any foreign company, including their personal company) in consideration of the individuals’ activities. Consequently, in the absence of the US-HU DTT as of 2024, the same tax situation continues based on the domestic rules as were previously been dictated by the US-HU DTT.\n\nAnother amendment implied by the termination of the US-HU DTT is the change in the taxation of interest paid by a company seated in a non-treaty country. Currently, this income is taxable as ’other income’ instead of interest income, however, as a result of the change, if the non-treaty country is otherwise an OECD member state, then the income obtained will actually be taxable as interest income.\n\nA similar change will take place with regard to controlled capital market transactions. If the income derives from a transaction carried out through an investment service provider operating in an OECD member state (even if Hungary does not have a double tax treaty with the given country), the income will be considered as originating from a controlled capital market transaction (of course, subject to compliance with additional conditions, e.g. the provider operates under local capital market supervision and there is exchange of information with the country’s supervisory authority).\n\nAs of 2024, the PIT Act will be expanded with a new tax-free solution, practically, with a new securities acquisition program. Pursuant to this, securities (shares, Ltd. participations) acquired free of charge or at a discount by employees and senior executives in start-up companies are exempt from tax. There are several conditions for the tax exemption. One of the conditions is that the participant does not sell the securities obtained in this way within 3 years of the securities being acquired. A special rule applies to securities acquired through exercising a stock option (or other similar right). For securities acquired in this way, the 3-year sales time limit must be calculated from the vesting date of the stock option. Pursuant to the new regulation, those companies are regarded as start-ups which are micro and small enterprises that was registered for no more than five years ago, is not listed on a stock exchange, was not established by a merger or a split-off, and has not yet paid dividends from its retained earnings.\n\nThe new rules contain several simplifications regarding the benefits provided by disbursers. The frequency of assessing, reporting and paying the related tax is to be changed from monthly to quarterly. Another relief is that the tax point of the income deriving from a service provided by a disburser directly will be the date when the accounting record (issued by the disburser) is available. Currently, the date of income realization is the date of the VAT tax point which could be an earlier date than the availability of the accounting record.\n\nThe rule based on which low value gifts can be provided three times a year as a defined specific benefit will also return. The value limit of the tax advantageous one time gift remains the same (10% of the minimum wage). The above changes make the tax administration of companies providing fringe benefits easier.\n\nPrizes from lottery-like games covered by the Act on Gambling will become tax free. For this reason, among others, lottery and keno prizes would be tax free according to the modifications.\n\nSocial security contributions\n\nThe contribution base of third-country national private individuals whose income becomes taxable abroad will be amended. This typically occurs in cases where such citizens are assigned from Hungary to a foreign country to perform work. Under the new rule, all income paid to such persons will be part of the contribution base. (Previously, the contribution base for this group of personnel was the base salary, but at least the average national monthly gross salary prevailing in July of the previous year as reported by the Hungarian Central Statistical Office.) This can significantly increase the employment cost of Hungarian companies assigning third-country national employees abroad, since, in addition to the higher contribution base, the social tax base of the company will be increased accordingly.\n\nSocial tax\n\nIndividuals considered as non-Hungarian residents for social security purposes (typically citizens of non-Hungarian and non-EU countries) do not currently have a social tax obligation in cases where an income does not form part of the contribution base (e.g. income from a legal relationship not triggering insurance liability). However, the amended rule clarifies that if income is being paid retroactively (e.g. bonus, reward) for Hungarian activities (spent originally under Hungarian insurance), there is an obligation to pay social tax, i.e. in this case the general exemption rule cannot be applied.\n\nThe personal scope of the social tax credit with respect to employees entering the labor market is modified. As of 2024, in addition to employees with Hungarian citizenship, the allowance can be applied regarding employees with Ukrainian and Serbian citizenships.\n\nPursuant to an amendment to the Act on Simplified Employment, the lump-sum tax would be classified as social tax in the future. However, social tax credits will not be available for these obligations.\n\nIn addition to the above, it is likely that significant changes will be introduced regarding the taxation of the private entrepreneurs from 2025, however, the relevant amendments were not included in the tax law amendment proposal. According to the reasoning, the previous proposal requires further consultations, as such, they are canceled for the time being.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nRoland Szabó\nDirector \nroland.szabo@vialto.com\n\nDénes Megyesi\nDirector \ndenes.megyesi@vialto.com\n\nMónika Keztyűs\nSenior Manager \nmonika.keztyus@vialto.com\n\nCsilla Schneider\nSenior Manager \ncsilla.schneider@vialto.com\n\nAndrea Cziegle-Gérecz\nManager\nandrea.gerecz@vialto.com",

        "date": "January 11, 2023",
        "content": "04 January 2023\n\nIndividual income tax and social security\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nLaw No. 370/2022 approving Government Ordinance No 16/2022 (GO 16/22) – that amends and supplements the Law No 227/2017 (Tax Code) -, repealing certain regulatory acts and other financial and fiscal measures and making amendments to GO 16/22, was published. The amendments apply as of 1 January 2023.\n\nThe Detail\n\nDetermining the turnover for facilities specific to construction industry\n\nChanges are made to the way the turnover is calculated in order to implement the construction industry facility. To determine the share of the turnover (of 80%) achieved from construction activity out of the total turnover, consider only the revenue from construction activity carried out on the territory of Romania, while the total turnover includes the revenue from all activity carried out on the territory of Romania. Activity carried out on the Romanian territory means activity carried out in Romania for the purpose of making products and providing services. Thus, for the calculation of the total turnover, the activity carried out abroad is excluded; previously also the activity carried out abroad was included in the total turnover.\n\nFor newly established employers, i.e., employers registered with the trade register/registered for tax purposes during the year, turnover shall be calculated cumulatively from the date of registration, including the month in which the exemption applies.\n\nFor existing employers on 1 January of each year, turnover shall be calculated cumulatively for the corresponding period of the current year, including the month in which the exemption applies.\n\nThe provisions related to the flat rate/deduction of 40% for rental income and income from intellectual property rights are eliminated from the article governing the method of assessment and payment of the annual tax due. Thus, an annual tax of 10% is due on taxable income/annual net taxable income by individuals deriving rental income, as well as by those who receive income from intellectual property rights.\n\nThis method of calculating the taxable base is not applicable for the taxpayers deriving rental income for which the net annual income is determined under the real system (i.e., gross income minus deductible expenses), income from leasing of agricultural goods from the personal patrimony and income from renting own dwellings for touristic purposes.\n\nFor dividends distributed based on interim financial statements prepared during 2022, the dividend tax rate shall be 5%, without any tax recalculation after adjustment on the basis of the annual financial statements for the financial year 2022. The dividend tax rate of 8% is applicable only to dividends distributed after 1 January 2023.\n\nPension contribution amendments\n\nThe annual basis for calculating the pension contribution in the case of individuals who earn self-employment income and income from intellectual property rights, is the taxpayer’s chosen income, which may not be less than:\n\n(a) 12 national minimum gross wages in force at the filing deadline of the annual single tax return – in the case of derived income between 12 and 24 (inclusively) national minimum gross wages;\n\n(b) 24 national minimum gross wages in force at the filing deadline of the annual single tax return – in the case of derived income of more than 24 national minimum gross wages.\n\nHealth insurance contribution amendments\n\nThe annual basis for calculating the health insurance contribution is of:\n\n(a) 6 national minimum gross wages in force at the filing deadline of the annual single tax return – in the case of derived income between 6 and 12 national minimum gross wages;\n\n(b) 12 national minimum gross wages in force at the filing deadline of the annual single tax return – in the case of derived income between 12 and 24 national minimum gross wages;\n\n(c) 24 national minimum gross wages in force at the filing deadline of the annual single tax return – in the case of derived income of more than 24 national minimum gross wages.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n• Irina Marinescu, Director | irina.marinescu@vialto.com\n• Ioana Petric, Manager | ioana.petric@vialto.com\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nThe UK Government has announced a phased process to automatically convert as many eligible Pre-Settled Status holders as possible to Settled Status without the need to make a further application.\n\nThe first automatic grants of Settled Status will begin from late January 2025.\n\nEmployees should regularly check and update their online immigration status account, especially when new passports are issued to make sure they are properly linked to their digital status.\n\nThe detail\n\nWhen the UK left the European Union, EEA nationals who were living in the UK by 31 December 2020 were invited to apply for an immigration status under the EU Settlement Scheme. Those that had been living in the UK for a least 5 years were granted Settled Status (an indefinite permission to remain). Those that were living in the UK for under 5 years were granted Pre-Settled Status (a one time five year permission to remain).\n\nIn 2023, the Home Office lost a High Court battle which challenged the inability to extend Pre-Settled Status and the need to make a further application for Settled Status once the five year threshold had been reached.\n\nConsequently, the Home Office amended the EU Settlement Scheme to grant automatic extensions of Pre-Settled Status every five years and announced plans to automate grants of Settled Status.\n\nThe roll out of the automation process will happen in phases. In the first phase, the Home Office will continue to extend individuals’ Pre-Settled Status, by a period of five years, for those approaching expiry of their Pre-Settled Status.\n\nThe Home Office will email Pre-Settled Status holders who are approaching the expiry of their status to inform them that they may soon be considered for an automated conversion to Settled Status. They expect to issue the first grants of Settled status under this new process from late January 2025.\n\nThe Home Office intends to expand the process later in 2025 to enable more eligible Pre-Settled Status holders to benefit from it. They are also considering the appropriate next steps for cases where a Pre-Settled Status holder has ceased to meet the conditions of their Pre-Settled Status due to not maintaining their continuous residence in the UK. Further information on this will be provided in due course.\n\nIt is important to note that Pre-Settled Status holders don’t need to wait to be converted to Settled Status. They can still apply for it as soon as they are eligible at www.gov.uk/eusettlementscheme. The introduction of this automated process will not prevent people from doing so.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nLyudmyla Davies\nPartner (Solicitor)\n\nIan Robinson\nPartner\n\nAndrea Als\nDirector (Solicitor)\n\nTom Marsom\nDirector (Solicitor)\n\nLucy Vaux\nSenior Manager (Solicitor)\n\nAwale Olad \nSenior Manager\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "title": "United States | Employment Tax | New York – Withholding and MCTMT Audits for 2020-2022 Tax Years",
        "date": "April 3, 2023",
        "content": "March 30, 2023\n\nSummary\n\nThe New York State (NYS) Department of Taxation and Finance (Department) has begun issuing audit notices to employers for the 2020 through 2022 tax years for state and city income tax withholding and Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax (MCTMT). Given the recent activity and informal conversations we’ve had with the Tax Department, NYS has renewed its focus on remote workers. We have already seen additional scrutiny on remote workers via personal income tax return reviews or audits for the 2020 and 2021 tax years and expect NYS to continue its detailed review at a larger scale on NYS employer withholding tax audits.\n\nThe Detail\n\nSince the issuance of withholding tax field audit guidelines in 2015 by the NYS Department, which was part of an initiative to ensure conformity and consistency in the withholding tax audit process and improve compliance among non-resident non-filers, NYS has routinely audited NYS employers. NYS’ approach has been to focus its audit review on employers rather than employees in order to cast a wider net in seeking tax revenue. NYS has leveraged the threat of penalties to increase employers’ level of compliance with withholding tax reporting requirements for wages earned in the State.\n\nWith the recent shift to remote work arrangements, we have seen NYS question individuals when seeking refunds on their personal income tax return for NYS tax withheld and reported on their Form W-2. Under NYS’ “Convenience of the Employer rule” and personal income tax guidance issued during COVID-19 by means of FAQs, NYS provided that non-resident employees assigned to a NYS work location and telecommuting from outside NYS for the employee’s convenience rather than the necessity of the employer are still subject to NYS taxes unless their employer had established a bona fide employer office at their telecommuting location.\n\nWith the commencement of audit notices being issued for the 2020 through 2022 tax years, we anticipate that NYS will renew its focus on remote workers and scrutinize employees that previously had a NYS work location which has now shifted elsewhere. Since a NYS withholding and MCTMT tax audit encompasses all employees paid out of the legal entity selected for audit and not just NYS employees, NYS can easily identify changes in employee work locations or those who had NYS wages previously reported to inquire about such changes. The electronic payroll data requested for an employer’s workforce includes a field for “Telecommuting Indicator” and the pre-audit questionnaire (NYS Withholding Tax TAA Field Audit Questionnaire (22 questions)) requires the employer to respond to a series of questions including whether the employer maintains work from home employees or telecommuters, to which office or work location remote work employees report into or which cost center the employees are associated with, and if NYS taxes were withheld. The burden of proof is placed on the employer to substantiate that NYS tax was properly withheld and timely remitted to the State.\n\nOther areas NYS has traditionally focused its employer withholding audit review include short term business travel and multi-year compensation elements and we expect the focus in these areas to continue. With respect to short term business travellers, NYS requests travel and expense records or office badge swipes for non-NYS based non-resident employees earning greater than $500,000 in federal taxable wages to determine whether any employees have exceeded 14 work days in the state. For multi-year compensation such as bonus, equity and deferred compensation payments, NYS will review employees that were previously assigned to a NYS work location in any of the previous five years but are no longer in NYS to determine whether they received wages earned in a prior year while working in NYS. The audit also covers NYS and NYC resident employees with under withheld tax as well as employees who have claimed more than 14 exemptions on Federal Form W-4 or NYS Form IT-2104. We have seen all of these areas result in significant liabilities for employers.\n\nNYS generally selects a sample year within the audit period and the results from the sample year will be extrapolated to the remaining audit years. Employers should take this into consideration when selecting a sample year as any significant events impacting the payroll such as an upgrade or change to the payroll system, acquisition or merger, or years with large number of employee transfers in/out of NYS, significant equity events, or large-scale payroll adjustments could skew the audit results.\n\nHow we can help\n\nVialto’s Employment and Payroll Tax Controversy Team offers assistance with federal, state, and local withholding and unemployment audit defense. Many of our professionals are former tax auditors, tax attorneys and supervisors who have the knowledge and professional insights to achieve successful results on these audits. Our team has over 15 years of experience in managing NYS withholding tax audits, is well versed in the NYS audit process, and maintains strong relationships with NYS auditors.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n• Tina Schrob, Partner | cristina.g.schrob@vialto.com\n• Greg Fetter, Partner | gregory.fetter@vialto.com\n• Ligeia Donis, Partner | ligeia.m.donis@vialto.com\n• Jessica Castro, Director | Jessica.j.castro.acevedo@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "October 3, 2023",
        "content": "28 September 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nThe bulletin provides an update about the new tax agreement signed on July 17, 2023 regarding the taxation of the Italian daily cross-borders working in Switzerland. This new agreement will affect the taxation of this specific category of taxpayers in the following three Cantons: Ticino (TI), Valais (VS) and Graubünden (GR).\n\nCurrent special tax regime\n\nSince October 1974, the Italian cross-borders working in Switzerland (TI, VS and GR) and\nliving in Italian municipalities located less than 20 kilometers from the Swiss border are subject to a special tax regime in place between Switzerland and Italy:\n\nThere is a transitional agreement for existing cases in place (see further explanations hereinafter).\n\nNew Agreement as of January 1, 2024\n\nA new agreement has been signed on July 17, 2023 and will enter into force as from January 1, 2024. The new special tax regime will cover all the cross-borders who will be starting to newly work as a cross-border in one of these cantons after July 17, 2023. Saying this, for calendar year 2023 those cross-borders will also be treated based on the 1974 tax regime and will swap to the new regime as of January 1, 2024. The “old cross-borders” will benefit of a transitional regime (see below).\n\nThe new rules which will be in place as from January 2024 are the following:\n\n• Annualization of the monthly salary to determine the tax rate;\n• consider the non-period elements;\n• make the potential necessary adjustments/corrections in the last pay slip of\nthe year when all the annual compensation components are known and final.\n\nTransitional regime for the “old cross-borders”\n\nAs previously mentioned, the new agreement signed in July 2023 will enter in force as from\nJanuary 2024. However, only the employees who started newly working as a cross-border after July 17, 2023 will be subject to the new tax regime.\n\nFor the “old cross-borders”, the previous special tax regime in place since 1974 remains applicable, with the following transitional regime process:\n\nWe recommend employers to carefully check the situation of each cross-border employee in order to determine which tax regime and related withholding tax process will be applicable as from January 2024. Moreover, adjustments to the payroll may need to be introduced.\n\nUseful links\n\nCanton Ticino, Tax at source authorities\n\nhttps://www4.ti.ch/dfe/dc/dichiarazione/imposte-alla-fonte-1/informazioni-sullimposte-alla-fonte\n\nCanton Graubünden, Tax at source authorities\n\nhttps://www.gr.ch/IT/istituzioni/amministrazione/dfg/stv/berechnen/Seiten/quellensteuer.aspx\n\nCanton Valais, Tax at source authorities\n\nhttps://www.vs.ch/web/scc/source\n\nOfficial list of the Italian municipalities part of the special tax regime of October 1974\nhttps://m4.ti.ch/fileadmin/DFE/DC/DOC-IF/aa_comuni/lista_comuni_frontiera_2018.pdf\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nNatalia Graf\nDirector \nnatalia.graf@vialto.com\n\nFranziska Tschirky\nSenior Manager \nfranziska.tschirky@vialto.com\n\nFabrizio Caiola\nManager \nfabrizio.a.caiola@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com",

Objections to the FAP index (if applicable) must be submitted in November 2023.\n\nThe Detail\n\nThe FAP is an index that varies from 0.5000 to 2.0000 and must be monthly multiplied by the RAT rate – Environmental Risks at Work (1%, 2% or 3%) – to determine a company’s social security obligations.\n\nThe FAP is reviewed annually by the Brazilian Ministry of Social Security at the end of September based on the history of work accidents that each one of the company´s establishments has presented in the last two years.\n\nConsidering the annual variation in the FAP index and the possible impacts on monthly social security contributions (which may result in increased payroll costs), it is important that employers review their FAP indexation factor to ensure it is correct. If any errors / issues are identified, it is possible to submit an objection against the annual indexation by presenting the appropriate justifications for disregarding or adjusting information used to compose the new value presented.\n\nThe deadline for contesting the FAP takes place during the month of November, and companies are responsible for accessing the dataprev website (fap.dataprev.gov.br) and consult their results, analyzing whether it is appropriate to present an impugnation requesting a reduction in this/these multiplier indexation.\n\nIn addition to the financial impacts, the FAP´s validation and impugnation could also lead to the gradual reduction of the indexation to be applied in subsequent years, considering that the mapping and investigation work increases employers’ attention on the subject.\n\nHow we can help\n\nThe Vialto Partners Brazil Employment Tax team can assist clients with identifying the impacts and/or opportunities resulting from these changes as well as implementing the required adjustments in the compensation package and payroll processing.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n• Flavia Fernandes, Country Leader | flavia.fernandes@vialto.com\n• Reinaldo Medina, Director | reinaldo.medina@vialto.com\n• Juliana Andres, Senior Manager | juliana.andres@vialto.com\n• Natalia SPinto, Manager | natalia.spinto@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

They should have a job offer from an entity in Qatar or financial means for three months (QAR 36,500 or more) to sustain themselves until their immigration process is finalised.\n\nIn order to succeed under the Entrepreneur category, the applicant must obtain an approval from any of the seven authorised Business Incubators, including the Qatar Science & Technology Park (QSTP), the Qatar University Business Incubation, the Media City and the Qatar Fintech Hub (QFH) with a project value at QAR 250,000 or more.\n\nAll applicants under both categories are required to visit the Mustaqel website to register an account, select the relevant category and provide specific documents required for each category. Additional documents will be required depending on the category and location applied from, such as a Qatar residence permit, an employment contract or non objection certificate from the local sponsor, work experience letter or proof, in addition to other required documentation.\n\nThe Government fee for the five-year Residence Permit under the Exceptional Talents category is QAR 4,000 (approximately USD 1,099), while the fee under the Entrepreneur category is QAR 5,000 (approximately USD 1,374).\n\nThe new Mustaqel Visa aligns with Qatar’s strategy for diversifying its economy and establishing a premier investor and business-friendly environment.

        "title": "India | Employment Tax | Amendment in Rent-Free Accommodation Valuation",
        "date": "September 7, 2023",
        "content": "06 September 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nThe Indian Tax Authorities recently notified lower rates for valuation of accommodation perquisite for Rent-free accommodation (RFA) provided by private sector employers to its employees (either owned or leased by the employer). The prescribed percentages applicable are linked to revised population threshold of cities in which the accommodation has been provided where the accommodation is owned by the employer. The authorities also introduced a cap in valuation based on the Cost Inflation Index (‘CII’) in case where the same accommodation is provided to same employee for more than one year. These changes are effective from 1 September 2023 onwards.\n\nThe Detail\n\nThe taxability of RFA is governed by Section 17(2) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1961 (‘the Act’), while the valuation of the perquisite is determined in accordance with Rule 3 of the Income Tax Rules, 1962 (‘the Rules’). The taxable value of perquisite depends on various factors such as whether accommodation is furnished or unfurnished, whether it is owned by the employer or taken on rent, etc.\n\nIn recent notifications issued by the CBDT [Central Board of Direct Taxes, India], the rules for valuation of RFA have been revised as follows:\n\nThere is no change/ amendment in the definition of salary to be considered for purpose of valuing the accommodation perquisite. Salary for the period the accommodation is occupied by the employee is to be considered. The taxable value as calculated shall be reduced by the amount of rent, if any, recovered from the employee.\n\nThe amendment also covers a situation where an employee consistently receives the same accommodation for over a year (whether company owned or leased). In such circumstances, the valuation of RFA in a subsequent year will not exceed the first year’s value, adjusted using CII (defined as 2023-24 or the financial year in which the accommodation was provided, whichever is later). Accordingly, taxable value of RFA in the subsequent year will be the lesser of:\n\n• Value computed according to the Rule 3; or\n• First year’s value adjusted by the CII\n\nAdjusted first year’s value = first year’s value * CII of the subsequent year / CII of the first year.\n\nThe amendments to Rule 3 are effective from 1 September 2023. Hence, valuations before 1 September 2023 will continue based on the existing valuation rules.\n\nExample:\nBased on the plain reading of the notifications, the accommodation perquisite will be valued as under:\n• An employee, Mr K, lives in a city having a population of 5 M.\n• His employer provides him with a company owned accommodation throughout the Financial Year (FY) 2023-24 and there is no rent recovered from the employee.\n• His monthly salary is INR 1,000,000 and he had received a bonus payment of INR 1,200,000 in December 2023.\n\nAssuming for FY 2024-25, Mr. K gets a bonus payment of INR 1,500,000 and his salary is increased from INR 1,000,000 to INR 1,300,000 per month, the perquisite would be computed as under if he continues to occupy the same accommodation in FY 2024-25 as well:\n\nCII – FY 2023-24: 348; FY 2024-25: 370 (assumed)\n\n\n\n–        Accommodation value (E = C * D) or\n\n–        First year’s value adjusted by the CII i.e. [1,570,000 *370/348]\n\n\n\nINR 2,565,000\n\n\n\nINR 1,710,000\n\nNote: A comparison of existing and new methods of determining the perquisite value of rent-free accommodation is shown in the above table only for reference purposes.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe rationalisation of Rule 3 in respect of RFA provided by the employer to employee comes as a respite as this brings down the taxable value of RFA in the wake of rising inflation. The linking of the valuation with the CII is a scientific way of valuation avoiding the requirements of rate rationalisation in future. This will help employees who are using employer provided accommodation for longer period as the taxable value will not exceed the first year’s valuation, adjusted with the CII.\n\n\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact or alternatively:\n\n·       Sundeep Agarwal, Partner | sundeep.agarwal@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\n\n\n© 2023 Vialto Partners.

        "title": "Belgium | Employment Tax | Shift work regulations — An update following the judgment of the Belgian constitutional court",
        "date": "May 31, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nBelgium | Shift work regulations – An update following the judgment of the Belgian constitutional court\n\nArticle 275/5 of the Income Tax Code (“CIR 92”)\n\nSummary\n\nIn a recent update (see our LinkedIn post), we have analyzed the interpretation made by the Constitutional Court with respect to the shift work regulations following the judgment published on 8th February 2024 and which dealt with the compatibility of this exemption with the principle of equality and non-discrimination.\n\nThe purpose of the analysis provided by the Court was to find out whether the principle of equality and nondiscrimination was (not) violated, taking into account the intention of the legislator, and whether it must be considered that only companies in which the teams always carry out the same amount of work within the framework of so-called “assembly” work can benefit from the exemption, whereas companies in which the amount of work of the teams varies depending on peak and trough time.\n\nGiven the uncertainty linked to the judgment provided by the Court, The Minister of Finance decided to intervene and as a result an agreement was reached by the federal government (the draft bill was published on 27 March 2024 and afterwards the Belgian Parliament adopted the law concerning the new exemption of withholding tax for shift work with variable shifts on 3 May 2024. The legislation has been published in the Belgian Official Gazette on 29 may 2024) on adjusting the tax regime for shift and continuous working, proposing an amendment offering a transitional measure until 31 December 2026.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that this transitional measure will also apply retroactively to the income year 2021 (as from 1 January 2021) and following.\n\nThis transitional measure is referred to as the “bis variant” of the initial exemption, which replaces the condition of equally scoped shifts with a proportional correction factor based on the deviation in the shift sizes.\n\nThe detail\n\nThe “bis” variant\n\nThe purpose of this amendment is to provide legal certainty for companies so that they do not find themselves in an ‘all or nothing’ situation. Companies will be offered the choice of remaining in the same system with the same conditions (the current law) or opting for the ‘bis’ variant of the current law, allowing them to benefit from the exemption even if the company does not have a team of the same size, but at a reduced percentage taking into account the difference in teams. This percentage is calculated in four stages.\n\n● Step 1 : determining the percentage applicable to the exemption: either 22.8% (shiftwork) or 25% (continuous work) in order to recalculate the exemption in full.\n\nFor the purpose of the example below, we will assume the calculation results in EUR 50.000.\n\n● Step 2 : define the difference in size between the teams, established in the numerator, and total the number of workers, established in the denominator. For example, let’s take the situation of shift work in 3 consecutive shifts on 2 days of the period (during the month) :\n\n○ Day 1 :\n■ Morning : 60 workers\n■ Afternoon : 40 workers\n■ Evening : 40 workers\n\n=> The difference between the size of the teams is 20, and the total number of workers is 140.\n\n○ Day 2 :\n■ Morning : 20 workers\n■ Afternoon : 10 workers\n■ Evening : 30 workers\n\n=> The difference between the size of the teams is 30, and the total number of workers is 60.\n\nAs we can see, the difference on the first day is 20/140 and the difference on the second day is 30/60.\n\n● Step 3 : the difference in the scope of work, which relates to the total period of the month, is determined. To do this, we need to add up all the numerators and denominators for the period in question. In our example, this would be: (50/200) = 25%.\n\n● Step 4 : reduce the amount obtained in the first step by the percentage determined in the third step. For example :\n\n○ Total exemption: EUR 50.000.\n○ Amount determined under step 3 (25%) = EUR 12.500\n○ Total exemption after applying the new measure : EUR 37.500 (EUR 50.000 – EUR 12.500)\n\nKey takeaways\n\nThe main point are as follows :\n\n● The transitional measure applies to remuneration paid or granted as of 1 January 2021 up to 31 December 2026.\n\n● The previous condition requiring the same scope for all shifts has been replaced. Now, a proportional correction factor will be applied and taking into account the size and frequency of shifts.\n\n● The Minister of Finance provided a number of explanations and examples in the explanatory note attached to the draft law and which could be raised in the context of an audit in order to defend a file depending on the situation of a company applying the shift work exemption.\n\n● In the explanatory note, the Minister of Finance has clearly indicated that it is not the intention of the legislator to apply the initial regime in its most strict sense. When a company has the intention to organize the work in equally scoped shifts, limited variations that occur due to circumstances such as illness, technical failures, etc, should not give rise to the disqualification of the exemption. An example is provided where there is a deviation of 5% which is disregarded.\n\n● One of the advantages of this transitional measure is that the size of the teams is no longer an obstacle to the exemption and can be applied on a larger scale. For companies that have not benefited from this exemption because of a significant difference in the size of their teams, there is now an opportunity to benefit from the exemption.\n\n● There is however a seemingly complex situation about the way this measure should be applied in practice regarding the deviation factor to be monitored on a daily basis from a payroll perspective. In order to apply this new transitional measure, the payroll providers will probably need to revise the way they are currently tracking the population of workers benefiting from the shift work.\n\n● As soon as the new transitional measure is picked by any given company instead of the “old” measures, it will not be possible for the company to apply the old measures going forward.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnton Scornea\nSenior Associate\n\nMyriam Boudinar\nSenior Manager\n\nMaxime Deforche\nManager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nPakistan | Global election—Pakistan parliamentary election\n\nSummary\nIn the upcoming Pakistan elections scheduled for February 8, 2024, a total of 128 million registered voters are expected to participate in selecting representatives of the National Assembly (lower house). The incumbent party is the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN), led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.\n\nThe election results are anticipated to shape Pakistan’s political landscape amid challenges such as military involvement, economic instability, and a desire for stability among the electorate. While corporate immigration policy is likely to be unaffected, the election results may result in stricter asylum policy, especially towards Afghan asylum seekers.\n\nThe detail\nThere are currently three political parties that have been reported to have the most likelihood of success in this year’s election. The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN), under the leadership of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, emerges as a clear frontrunner, with perceived support from the military establishment. This party aims to reclaim its voter support base, and international observers expect this party to emerge as the largest in this election.\n\nThe Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), founded by former cricketer and politician Imran Khan, currently led by Gohar Ali Khan, faces hurdles but maintains widespread popular support. The Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), led by Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, son of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, was the third-largest after the previous election. While international predictions may deem PPP unlikely to win outright, its potential role in a governing alliance has been reported.\n\nWhat this means\nPakistan’s recent immigration policy reflects the government’s coordinated effort to address security concerns and is unlikely to change following the election.\n\nThe government has initiated measures against undocumented immigrants, including Afghan nationals. A strict policy on voluntary departure or potential expulsion has been implemented, involving measures including arrest, detention, and subsequent removal to Afghanistan. However no specific policy measures have been taken yet or are expected to be implemented in respect of corporate immigration, however Vialto Partners continues to monitor the situation closely.\n\nContact us\nShould you require more information, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively the Vialto Partners; global election team:\n\nSharan Kundi\nGlobal Immigration Leader\n\nRaj Mann\nDirector, Global Immigration Advisory Lead\n\nHugo Vijge\nDirector, Immigration\n\nMarijan Vrhovac\nSenior Associate, Immigration\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit: www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nContact us on the following address: me-immigration@vialto.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

Governments around the Middle East have announced that during this month, Government offices as well as the private sector will observe shorter working hours.\n\nThe Detail\n\nImmigration processing delays are expected throughout the next few weeks during the month of Ramadan, and may continue in the weeks following the ‘Eid’ period, marking the end of Ramadan. Companies and Government offices will adopt reduced working hours across the Middle East. The Private sector in the UAE will reduce their working hours by two hours as per the Labour Law, and this applies to non-fasting employees as well (except in the DIFC and ADGM).\n\nWhat this means\n\nEmployers and employees should anticipate processing delays during this period, and Government offices as well as the private sector will close for 3-4 days during ‘Eid Al Fitr’, immediately following the month of Ramadan. In case of time sensitive applications, companies should plan ahead and consider applications may take longer to process due to reduced Government working hours.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe will continue to closely monitor and provide timely guidance on any new updates by the Immigration authorities in the Middle East concerning the upcoming public ‘Eid’ holiday, and help anticipate any delays with regards to the immigration process of your expatriate workforce.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnir Chatterji, EMEA Immigration Partner | anir.chatterji@vialto.com\n\nRekha Simpson, Director, Middle East Immigration | rekha.simpson@vialto.com\n\nDounia Fathi, Sr Manager, Middle East Immigration | dounia.fathi- enbrahim@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\n\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "24 April 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nNew Zealand citizens living in Australia will have a direct pathway to Australian citizenship from 1 July 2023. This means that New Zealanders holding a Special Category Visa (subclass 444 visa) will not be required to become Australian permanent residents prior to an Australian citizenship application.\n\nIn addition, any child born in Australia on or after 1 July 2022 to a New Zealand citizen holding a Special Category Visa may automatically acquire Australian citizenship at birth. This change will also take effect from 1 July 2023.\n\nThe Detail\n\nFrom 1 July 2023, New Zealand citizens who have been living in Australia for four years or more will be eligible to apply directly for Australian citizenship. They will no longer need to first apply for and be granted a permanent visa. These changes apply to New Zealand citizens holding a Special Category (subclass 444) visa who arrived in Australia after 26 February 2001.\n\nFor background, the general residence requirement for Australian citizenship includes:\n\nApplicants must have lived in Australia on any visa for a period of at least four years prior to citizenship application, and\n\nApplicants must have been an Australian permanent resident for at least 12 months immediately prior to citizenship application.\n\nFor New Zealand citizens who are long-term residents in Australia, the general residency requirements will be met by backdating their period of permanent residence for citizenship purposes. This will allow them to meet the 12-month permanent residence period under the general residence requirement as outlined above.\n\nWith effect from 1 July 2023:\n\nAll New Zealand citizens holding a Special Category Visa will be considered permanent residents for citizenship purposes.\n\nNew Zealand citizens granted a Special Category Visa before 1 July 2022 will have their period of permanent residence for citizenship purposes backdated to 1 July 2022.\n\nNew Zealand citizens granted a Special Category Visa for the first time on or after 1 July 2022 will be considered a permanent resident for citizenship purposes from the date of their Special Category Visa grant.\n\nThe above provisions will apply to New Zealand citizens in Australia. They will also apply to New Zealand citizens who are overseas, but held a Special Category Visa immediately before last leaving Australia.\n\nThese provisions will not apply to citizenship applications submitted before 1 July 2023. Current citizenship criteria will continue to apply until 30 June 2023.\n\nThe backdating of permanent residence for Special Category Visa holders will also impact their children.

Previously, applicants had to visit SACA in person for attestation.\n\nThe Detail\nThe Saudi Arabia Cultural Attache (SACA) has implemented a new process for attesting non-Saudi degree certificates for select foreign nationals. As of August 29, 2023, applicants can utilise the government’s online platform, Mosadaqa, to complete the initial step of attestation electronically. This marks a departure from the previous requirement of in-person attestation at SACA.\n\nInitially, Mosadaqa accepted degree certificates from educational institutions in Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Palestine, and in a recent update on the 14th November, this list has extended to include Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. The platform covers a range of educational qualifications, including college diplomas, bachelor’s degrees, higher diplomas, master’s degrees, and PhD degrees.\n\nTo initiate the attestation process through Mosadaqa, applicants must create an account on the platform and provide detailed information about themselves and their educational background. The required documents for submission include scanned copies of the applicant’s passport, national identification card, official certificate (authenticated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the degree-issuing country), and transcripts.\n\nApplicants are also required to pay a fee for the attestation service using either a Visa or Mastercard credit card through the online platform.\n\nIt is important to note that despite the introduction of electronic attestation, eligible foreign nationals must complete a second step in the process. Once the electronic attestation is completed by SACA, applicants must physically visit the Saudi Embassy in the country where their degree was issued to manually verify their degree.\n\nHow we can help\nWe are closely monitoring these changes in Saudi Arabia, and can advise you with respect to the impact of those changes as well as conduct any assessments your business might need to comply with the new requirements.\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnir Chatterji\nEMEA Immigration Partner\nanir.chatterji@vialto.com\n\nAli Ibrahim\nDirector, KSA and Bahrain Lead\nali.a.ibrahim@vialto.com\n\nAhmed Amer\nManager\nahmed.amer@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\n© 2023 Vialto Partners.

The law takes effect on July 1, 2025.\n\nThe detail\n\n1. The new pension law establishes a pension system based on four pillars:\n\n2. Contributions: Pension contributions remain calculated at 16% of the Contribution Base Income (IBC) reported monthly. However, individuals with a base income greater than 4 legal monthly minimum wages (SMLMV) must pay an additional contribution to the pension and subsistence solidarity fund, which varies between 1% and 3% depending on the number of SMLMV reported:\n\n\n\nBetween 4 and 7 MMLS\n\n1.5%\n\nBetween 7 and 11 MMLS\n\n1.8%\n\nBetween 11 and 19 MMLS\n\n2.5%\n\n2.8%\n\n3%\n\n3. Foreign employees: The requirements remain unchanged. Foreign employees are not required to make contributions in Colombia if they are already contributing in their country of origin or in another country.\n\n4. Companies as contracting parties: Companies must deduct pension contributions from their contractors and transfer them to the pension system.\n\n5. Requirements for old-age pension: A single pension is calculated by combining 2 components:\n\ni. Prima Media scheme:\n\nR = 65.50 – 0.50s\ns = Number of minimum wages corresponding to the contribution base of the Prima Media pillar.\n\nii. Ahorro Individual scheme: The pension is calculated using an actuarial formula that provides a monthly income until death and covers legal beneficiaries as well.\n\n6. Transition regime: The law does not apply to individuals who have 750 weeks of contributions (for women) and 900 weeks of contributions (for men) by the time the law takes effect on July 1, 2025.\n\nActions\n\nCompanies should wait for further instructions from the Government as the law will be regulated and take effect in July 2025. However, the following areas may be impacted:\n\nAdditionally, Companies may communicate these changes to employees to help them understand the new law, including the different pillars, the transition regime and how the new regulations will impact their pension.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMelissa Russo Coba\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

This includes applicants for Adjustment of Status (AOS), Asylum, or Cancellation of Removal, and those admitted as refugees, asylees, and recipients of withholding of removal. The increased validity period is intended to reduce the frequency with which noncitizens must file to renew their work authorization. Additionally, the 5-year validity period is anticipated to reduce the associated workload and processing times for USCIS officers, which will allow the agency to concentrate its efforts on initial work authorization caseload.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe extended 5-year validity for AOS-based EADs will provide both employees and employers stability as it mitigates the need for frequent work authorization renewals while an employee’s AOS application is pending.\n\nAOS applicants frequently filed with both an EAD and Advance Parole (AP) document, which authorizes international travel while an AOS application is pending. The new increase in validity period for EADs does not, however, apply to AP documents. Thus, the AP validity period for initial and renewal  documents will remain at one (1) year.\n\nWe will be closely monitoring the processing times for all EAD applications as USCIS has indicated that one of the reasons for this extension of validity is to help process EAD initial and renewal applications.\n\nContact us\n\nPlease reach out to Manish Daftari (manish.daftari@vialto.com) to discuss further.",

This is due to a recent update from ICP who confirmed that the option of sponsorship transfer from a previous to new employer (named Release sign-out and Release sign-in option in some jurisdictions) within the same freezone or other freezone jurisdictions is no longer available. At this stage, it is our understanding that the above applies to multiple freezones in the UAE, however, we will continue to monitor this update to see if any further developments are announced by the authorities.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe new process requires additional steps (cancellation and then re-application) for an employee to legally change employers, this will most likely result in additional processing times and therefore could impact future employee’s start dates.\n\nFurthermore, as a result of the new measures, dependent visas of employees who are impacted will also need to be cancelled and reapplied or put on hold/freeze to facilitate the cancellation of the existing residence permit and application of new permits by the new employer.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe will continue to closely monitor and provide timely guidance on any new updates by the UAE Immigration authorities, and highlight the impact of any changes to your expatriate workforce. Please reach out to us for an in-depth review of any current or near future transfers and we are happy to further assess the impact on your company.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnir Chatterji\nEMEA Immigration Partner\nanir.chatterji@vialto.com\n\nRekha Simpson\nDirector, Middle East Immigration\nrekha.simpson@vialto.com\n\nRens Jongerius\nManager, Middle East Immigration\nrens.jongerius@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts",

        "content": "Payroll\n\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia | Saudi Arabia launches wage insurance service for expatriate workers in private sector\n\nSummary\n\nSaudi Arabia has introduced a wage insurance scheme to protect expatriate workers in the private sector. Effective 6 October 2024, the scheme ensures workers receive their wages if employers default, without absolving employers of their responsibilities. The insurance also covers travel costs for workers wishing to return home.\n\nThe detail\n\nSaudi Arabia’s Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (MHRSD) in collaboration with the Saudi Arabian Insurance Authority, has introduced the Expatriate Worker Wage Insurance Service, effective 6 October 2024. This initiative aims to protect the rights of foreign workers in the private sector by allowing them to claim outstanding wages if their employers fail to meet payment obligations due to financial distress or insolvency.\n\nThis service is a significant step toward enhancing worker protections in the Kingdom’s labor market. One of the Ministers emphasized that it reflects ongoing efforts to safeguard expatriate workers’ rights and improve the labor market’s attractiveness. The wage insurance serves as a safety net, ensuring fair compensation even in extreme circumstances.\n\nWho is Covered and Exempted?\n\nThe insurance service covers all expatriate workers employed by establishments with commercial registrations, except for certain exempted categories:\n\nInsurance Service Benefits:\n\nThe Ministry bears the cost of the insurance service and its application. Once the insurance company has disbursed compensation to the workers, it is entitled to seek reimbursement from the employer (establishment) where the workers were employed. The insurance company can demand reimbursement for the compensation amounts paid to the workers, either in full or in part.\n\nImportantly, while this insurance offers crucial support to workers, employers remain legally obligated to pay wages on time per the existing Wage Protection System (WPS), with penalties for non-compliance.\n\nThis initiative aligns with Saudi Vision 2030, reflecting broader efforts to create a more equitable and secure labor environment, enhancing the efficiency and attractiveness of the Saudi labor market for both workers and employers.\n\nHow we can help\n\nIt is essential for businesses to stay informed about the new Expatriate Worker Wage Insurance Service and the recent labor reforms introduced by the Saudi Arabian government to understand their impact on operations. While employers remain responsible for ensuring timely wage payments, it’s crucial for businesses to evaluate how this insurance may affect their financial management and compliance strategies. Our team is well-equipped to provide the necessary guidance and support to ensure compliance with these new requirements. We will also continuously monitor updates from the Saudi government and help businesses navigate this transition smoothly.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnir Chatterji\nEMEA Immigration Partner\n\nAli Ibrahim\nDirector, Middle East Immigration\n\nJammy Mustafa\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Saudi Arabia | Saudisation and visa updates",
        "date": "February 27, 2025",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nSaudi Arabia has announced several key Immigration and workforce policy changes that will impact employers and residents. These updates include new Saudisation rates for various professions, changes to visa extensions and renewals for residents and their dependents, and new requirements for exit visa applications. The key developments are as follows:\n\nNew Saudisation rates have been rolled out for over 269 professions in sectors such as healthcare, engineering and accounting, and will take effect from 27 July 2025;\n\nSaudi residents can extend their exit and re-entry visas while out of the country, and dependents of residents as well as domestic workers located outside of Saudi Arabia can now renew their resident IDs while outside of the country;\n\nHolders of a residence permit in Saudi Arabia must now ensure their permit has at least 30 days of validity before applying for an exit visa.\n\nThe detail\n\nSaudisation\n\nThe Saudi Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (MHRSD) has just announced a major move to enhance Saudisation across a variety of industries. Effective 27 July 2025, these new regulations will significantly raise the Saudisation rates for over 269 professions in sectors such as healthcare, engineering, accounting, and more. Key highlights include:\n\nPharmacy Sector: Saudisation to be raised to 55% for general pharmacy activities and 65% for pharmacy activities within hospitals;\n\nDentistry Professions: Starting with 45% Saudisation in July 2025, and progressing to 55% after one year;\n\nAccounting Professions: Saudisation to gradually rise over five years, with an initial 40% in 2025, reaching 70% by 2028;\n\nEngineering Professions: Saudisation to be set at 30% for engineering technical professions from the previous 25%.\n\nRenewal of exit & re-entry visas and resident ID’s\n\nResidents who are outside the Kingdom can extend their exit and re-entry visas – both single and multiple-entry while being out of the country. These services can be accessed through two platforms:  Absher (Ministry of Interior’s electronic platform) and the Muqeem Portal. Tl. Dependents of residents and domestic workers located outside of Saudi Arabia can also renew their resident IDs while outside of the country.\n\nRequired 30 day validity residence permit for exit\n\nEffective immediately, holders of a resident permit in Saudi Arabia must ensure their resident permit has at least 30 days of validity before applying for an exit visa (or renew their residence permit first). Previously, foreign nationals could apply for an exit visa up until the last day of their permit, while from now on a renewal would be required first to ensure a minimum of 30 days validity. Premium resident permits will not be subject to the new exit visa requirements.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe new Saudisation initiatives and increased Saudisation rates boost local workforce across key professional sectors and aim to stimulate local labour market participation. Employers should factor in these Saudisation rates in their workforce planning and adapt their policies accordingly. The visa renewal procedures allow for a smoother process for expatriates and their families to renew their permits while outside of the country.\n\nHow we can help\n\nAt Vialto Partners, we provide expert guidance on navigating Saudi Arabia’s immigration policies and their implications for businesses and employees. We are closely monitoring the above changes and can advise you with respect to the impact of those changes as well as conduct any assessments your business might need to comply with the new requirements.

        "title": "United Kingdom | Immigration  | Creative Worker visa route: New MAC recommendations",
        "date": "October 9, 2023",
        "content": "06 October 2023\n\nImmigration insights\n\nImpact: Medium\n\nSummary\n\nOn 3 October 2023, the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) published a report following a major review of the Shortage Occupation List. Within the detail of the report some interesting recommendations emerged that could result in fundamental (and mostly positive, we believe) changes to the Creative Worker visa route with the abolition of the resident labour market test. However, creative roles could be removed from the Shortage Occupation List which may result in slightly higher salary requirements.\n\nIf the recommendations are accepted, we do not expect any immigration rule changes until Spring 2024.\n\nThe Detail\n\nAs a quick reminder, eligibility for a Creative Worker visa is linked to either:\n\nShortage Occupation List\n\nThe MAC report recommends that job roles associated with the Creative Worker route are no longer eligible for inclusion on the Shortage Occupation List.\n\nThis potentially means:\n\nResident Labour Market Test\n\nThe MAC is also recommending that employers are allowed to sponsor any occupation that is currently eligible for the Skilled Worker route without having to perform a resident labour market test.\n\nIf this recommendation is taken up by the Home Office, we believe this would be very welcomed indeed by employers. At the moment, the need for a resident labour market test seems an out-of-date requirement that unnecessarily slows the hiring process down – particularly since the test has already been removed for the Skilled Worker category and there is recognised shortage of sufficient numbers of UK-based talent for globally in-demand roles in the creative sector such as VFX artists, for example.\n\nAn issue not addressed by the MAC report, but follows from its two main recommendations, are the changes that would need to be made to the current Creative Worker Codes of Practice for certain creative roles – such a performers in tv/film, ballet, dance, opera and theatre. The Codes heavily refer to exemptions to the resident labour market test and the protocol for conducting one where exemptions do not apply.\n\nGoing further, if the Home Office does implement the MAC’s recommendations, it may be that the purpose of the Codes no longer exists. If so, none of the three sponsorship eligibility requirements of the Creative Worker visa route mentioned above would apply.\n\nWhat then? New eligibility requirements for the route? We hope not. Rather, the Home Office could simply make it easier and quicker for employers to bring creatives to the UK as long as they meet certain salary requirements (either the going rates/national minimums/PACT or EQUITY minimums) for the roles they are sponsored under.\n\nWhen could these changes be implemented?\n\nIf the Home Office decides to take up the MAC’s two main recommendations for the Creative Worker visa route, we would not expect these to take effect until late Spring 2024.\n\nIf we receive any updates on this matter from the Home Office, we will reach out to you to let you know.\n\nContact us\n\nTo discuss the potential implications of the MAC’s recommendations on your business, please do reach out to us on:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nKenya | National social security fund (NSSF) act, 2013\n\nSummary\nThe National Social Security Fund (NSSF) is a state-run pension scheme in Kenya where employers and employees make mandatory monthly contributions. The intention of the new NSSF Act is to have progressive deductions over a five-year period. However, there was uncertainty on the implementation when the Employment and Labor Relations Court (ELRC) declared the Act unconstitutional. The Kenyan court of appeal in its ruling reversed the ELRC position setting base for implementation of the new NSSF Act, 2013.\n\nThe Detail\nThe NSSF Act, 2013 second year contributions rates are implementable come February 2024. Accordingly, the NSSF issued a public notice on 11th January 2024 reminding both employers and employees of the NSSF rates applicable effective February 2024 via payroll.\n\nIn accordance with the NSSF Act, 2013 third Schedule, year 2 new monthly contribution rates will be:\na) Lower Limit (Tier 1) – The Tier 1 limit increased from KES 6,000 to KES 7,000, raising the minimum contribution from KES 360 to KES 420 per month.\nb) Upper Limit (Tier 2) – The Tier 2 limit was increased from KES 18,000 to KES 36,000 raising maximum contribution from KES 720 to KES 1740 per month.\n\nWhat this means\nThis notice doesn’t change contribution remittance due date i.e., the 9th day of the month following the payroll month. However, it serves as reminder to employers update their payroll systems for the purpose of compliance. Effectively this slightly increases employees’ savings and contribution benefit slightly.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAndrew Ondieki\nDirector\n\nKennedy Kyalo\nSenior Manager\n\nDavid Muasya\nSenior Associate\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit: www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Ireland | Employment Tax | Company car benefit-in-kind – temporary changes",
        "date": "March 31, 2023",
        "content": "09 March 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nWhere an employer provides a vehicle (car or van) that is available to an employee for his or her private use, a benefit-in-kind (BIK) tax charge will typically arise.\n\nFrom 1 January 2023, the taxable BIK rules for petrol and diesel cars were changed to include vehicle emission categories (see our prior bulletin here). As a result of the change, the net pay of individuals who are provided with less environmentally friendly cars has been negatively impacted. Users of employer-provided electric cars have also been negatively impacted as the favourable BIK treatment introduced in 2017 is being phased out between 2023 and 2026.\n\nThese changes, although signalled well in advance, were not well received by employees due to the fact that their net pay has decreased (in some cases quite significantly) at a time when many are struggling to deal with high energy prices and cost of living challenges.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Government announced that a Finance Bill would be introduced to provide for the extension or amendment of some existing cost of living measures. In a statement on 7 March 2023, it was confirmed that a temporary change to the recently introduced BIK rules is to be included in these cost of living measures.\n\nThe Detail\n\nWhile details of the bill have yet to be published (this is expected in the coming days), the Government has announced that a relief of €10,000 will be applied to the Original Market Value (OMV) of cars in Category A – D to reduce the amount of BIK payable. The relief will not apply to cars in Category E, i.e vehicles with the highest CO2 emissions (details on categories A -E and the associated emission ranges are available in our prior bulletin).\n\nAccordingly, for the purposes of calculating the BIK liability, employers may reduce the OMV by €10,000. This treatment will apply equally to all cars, vans and electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nFor EVs, the OMV deduction of €10,000 will be in addition to the existing relief of €35,000 that is currently available, meaning that the total relief for EVs in 2023 will be €45,000.\n\nThe upper limit in the highest mileage band will also be amended by way of a 4,000km reduction, so that the highest mileage band will now be entered into at 48,001km – see the updated table below.\n\nExample:\n\nJohn has the use of a car provided by his employer; it has an OMV of €35,000. John travels 47,000 kilometres on business each year. Per the manufacturer, the car produces 85g/km in CO₂ emissions (category B).\n\nThe annual 2023 BIK before the temporary measure is introduced would be €5,513, i.e. 35,000 x 15.75%.\n\nThe annual 2023 BIK after the temporary measure is applied will be €3,938, i.e €25,000 x 15.75%.\n\nJohn pays tax and PRSI totalling 52% on this BIK, meaning that John’s annual take home pay will increase by €819 as a result of the temporary change (5,513 – 3,938 @ 52%).\n\nEmployer PRSI on the BIK will also decrease by €174 (5,513 – 3,938 @ 11.05%).\n\nThese temporary measures will be retrospectively applied from 1 January 2023 and will remain in place until 31 December 2023.\n\nWhat this means\n\nWhile the temporary change for the 2023 tax year will be welcomed by employees, it will give rise to a considerable amount of additional work for employers, who already incurred significant time in January adjusting for the changes.\n\nThe actions now required for employers are as follows:\n\n1. Re-calculate the annual 2023 BIK charge for all employees who have use of a company car/van.\n\n2. Undertake an exercise to ensure that the year-to-date BIK position for 2023 is correct in light of these changes.\n\n3. Communicate details of the temporary BIK changes to employees.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n● Ian McCall, Partner | ian.mccall@vialto.com\n\n● Aoife Reid, Partner | aoife.reid@vialto.com\n\n● Keith Connaughton, Partner | keith.connaughton@vialto.com\n\n● Clara Flynn, Director | clara.flynn@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "April 3, 2023",
        "content": "February 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact: High\n\nKey Proposals in Personal Tax Domain\n\nThe Hon’ble Finance Minister (FM) of India presented the Union Budget 2023 on 01 February 2023. The budget continues to focus on the Government’s agenda of simplified tax structure by reducing compliance burden, improving tax administration, promote the entrepreneurial spirit and provide tax relief to citizens. The FM indicated the Government’s intention of continuing improving the services to the taxpayers by rolling out a next-generation common Income Tax Return Form, by strengthening the grievance redressal mechanism, etc.\n\nThe budget 2023 has brought mixed bag of feelings for different class of taxpayers from personal tax perspective. The FM started her Budget Speech on personal income tax chapter with an acknowledgment of tax burden on middle class taxpayers and thereafter went towards the high-income earners. The budget has also focused on plugging of certain loopholes to curb the misuse of some beneficial provisions under the Income tax Act.\n\nThere are quite a few changes proposed by the FM in personal tax section, for the salaried employees, taxpayers having capital gain transactions, receipts from insurance companies, presumptive taxation, tax withholding rates (other than on salary), etc. However, here we are discussing a few of these changes in detail which may have an impact on the larger employee population.\n\nChanges proposed in Tax Regime\n\nBy way of background, currently, there are two personal tax regimes, Old Tax Regime (OTR) and New Personal Tax Regime (NPTR), having its own income slab and tax rates along with certain prescribed terms and compliances for choosing either of the regime by the taxpayers (whichever is tax beneficial for them). The taxpayers are free to change the tax regime every year, subject to certain conditions, such as filing of tax return within the prescribed timelines, certain specific restrictions for the taxpayers having business income, etc.\n\nFurther, if the employer has withheld taxes on salary under any particular tax regime (on the request/ declaration of the employee), the employee can change the tax regime at the time of filing his personal tax return if the other tax regime is more tax beneficial to him/ her. The OTR is a default tax regime.\n\nIt has been proposed to make the NPTR as a default tax regime and certain changes in the income slab and tax rates have been proposed under the NPTR. There are no changes in the OTR.\n\nTax Rates under existing and proposed NPTR\n\nThe tax rates under OTR are as follows (no changes proposed):\n\n* Tax rates including surcharge and education cess are mentioned\n\nCurrently, in case a taxpayer wants to opt for NPTR, he is required to notify his employer. Going forward, in case a taxpayer wishes to opt for OTR, whether he is required to notify the employer or not, needs further clarification from the tax department.\n\nThe impact of the above proposals through certain illustrations\n\nExample – 1 Assuming salary income INR 900,000 and no exemptions are available except Standard Deduction\n\nExample – 2 Assuming salary income INR 1,300,000 and employee is eligible for certain deductions\n\nExample – 3 Assuming salary income INR 2,000,000 and certain eligible exemptions\n\nExample – 4 Assuming salary income of INR 60,000,000\n\nBased on the above examples, it is clear that the taxpayer needs to evaluate which tax regime is beneficial to him/ her by comparing the tax rates, availability and quantum of exemptions/ deductions, etc. under both the regimes before taking any decision.\n\nEnactment of the Budget 2023\n\nThe Finance Bill 2023 will now be presented before both the Houses of Parliament for their assent. After the Bill is passed from Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and it receives President’s approval for the enactment as Finance Act 2023.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "United Kingdom | HMRC updates guidance for non-resident directors’ concession",
        "date": "November 19, 2024",
        "content": "In a recent update to its National Insurance Contributions manual (NIM), HMRC have formally revised the administrative concession for non-UK resident directors of UK companies (specifically within NIM12013), which materially changes the eligibility criteria. This brings the guidance in line with the one in the CA44 Booklet (CA44: National Insurance for company directors), which was updated to reflect the same guidance starting with the tax year 2020/21).\n\nThe concession allows non-resident directors to visit the UK and not trigger a liability to Class 1 NICs on earnings from a UK company where they satisfy some specific conditions. The updated guidance in the NIM states that the concession can only be applied where the director comes from a country which does not have a social security agreement with the UK.\n\nFor some time, HMRC have provided an administrative concession that allows non-UK resident directors to avoid Class 1 NICs liability on income earned from a UK company, provided they meet specific criteria:\n\nUnder the previous guidance in the National Insurance Manual, the concession was available to nonresident directors from any location provided the director met the eligibility conditions and this domestic concession would not interfere with the terms of the international agreements the UK might have been a part of.\n\nThe updated guidance has introduced a key wording change, such that it now confirms that the administrative concession can only apply to non-resident directors coming from a country without a social security agreement with the UK.\n\nTherefore, individuals coming from agreement and EU/EEA countries and Switzerland are specifically excluded and the concession cannot apply to them (in line with the guidance in the CA44 Booklet). Such individuals may still utilise the terms of a Social Security Agreement to be exempt from UK NIC should it be the case. The updated guidance corrects a lack of alignment between the guidance provided by HMRC in the NIM and that in the CA44 Booklet.\n\nTo navigate these changes effectively, it is essential that both non-resident directors and UK companies fully understand the updated requirements. Companies should also stay up to date with these changes to avoid potential liabilities or penalties. The scope of the concession has been significantly limited (aligning it to the existing CA44 guidance) and therefore it is essential to ensure that the social security treatment applied for non-resident directors remains correct and eligibility criteria continue to be met.\n\nIndividuals coming from the EU/EEA, Switzerland or reciprocal agreement countries should not rely on the concession and the provisions in the relevant social security agreement should be reviewed to identify if any favourable clauses could be used to claim exemptions from UK National Insurance contributions.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nDavid Crew\nManager\n\nAndrei loanei\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

These draws will focus on candidates with Canadian work experience eligible under the Canadian Experience Class (CEC). Francophone immigration applicants will continue to be a priority as well as addressing labour shortages outlined in the 2025-2027 Immigration Levels Plan in healthcare, trades, and education sectors. The list of eligible occupations has been updated for each category.\n\nThe detail\n\nPreviously, the Government of Canada selected agriculture, healthcare, Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM), trades, transportation, and French language as the focus categories in 2024. By contrast, for 2025, education has been added to the list, while transportation has been removed. The healthcare sector now includes social services. Notably, the STEM category has removed software engineers, computer and information systems managers and data scientists and added select engineering occupations.\n\nCategory-based draws will see invitations extended to candidates with strong French language proficiency or at least 6 months of full-time, continuous and recent work experience in one of the following fields:\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe 2025 category-based draws will benefit Canadian employers in some key industry sectors, by enhancing opportunities for temporary foreign workers to transition to permanent residence and alleviate identified labour market shortages. For organizations impacted by the elimination of key STEM occupations such as software engineers, computer and information systems managers and data scientists, there may be opportunities through certain provincial nomination programs. It’s important for Canadian employers to ensure they are informed of not only the federal immigration program, but the provincial immigration programs that seek to address more localized labour market needs and priorities.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nNadine Landry\nPartner\n\nMelodie Molina\nPartner\n\nSusan Martyn\nPartner\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.

Ces tirages prioriseront les candidats ayant une expérience de travail canadienne admissible à la Catégorie de l’expérience canadienne (CEC). Les candidats francophones et les domaines de la santé et de l’éducation ainsi que les ouvriers spécialisés, des secteurs en forte pénurie de main-d’oeuvre selon le Plan des niveaux d’immigration 2025-2027, continueront d’être priorisés. La liste des professions admissibles a été mise à jour pour chaque catégorie.\n\nEn détail\n\nEn 2024, l’agriculture, les soins de la santé, les sciences, la technologie, l’ingénierie et les mathématiques (STIM), les ouvriers spécialisés, les transports et les candidats francophones avaient été ciblés comme catégories prioritaires par le gouvernement canadien. En revanche, en 2025, l’éducation a été ajoutée à la liste, tandis que les transports ont été supprimés. De plus, le secteur des soins de la santé comprend désormais les services sociaux. Enfin, il est important de souligner que les développeurs de logiciels, les gestionnaires de systèmes informatiques et les scientifiques des données ont été retirés de la catégorie STIM, alors que certaines professions en ingénierie ont été ajoutées.\n\nLes tirages par catégorie seront effectués en invitant les candidats ayant une bonne maîtrise du français ou au moins six (6) mois d’expérience de travail à temps plein, continue et récente dans l’un des domaines suivants :\n\nCe que cela signifie\n\nLes tirages par catégorie en 2025 profiteront aux employeurs canadiens de certains secteurs clés tout en améliorant les possibilités pour les travailleurs étrangers temporaires de faire la transition vers la résidence permanente et en atténuant les pénuries de main-d’oeuvre identifiées. Pour les secteurs touchés par le retrait de professions en STIM, comme les développeurs de logiciel, les gestionnaires de systèmes informatiques et les scientifiques de données, il pourrait y avoir des possibilités via certains programmes provinciaux de nomination. Il est important que les employeurs canadiens soient informés non seulement du programme fédéral d’immigration, mais également des programmes d’immigration provinciaux cherchant à répondre aux besoins et aux priorités locales du marché du travail.\n\nContactez-nous\n\nPour plus d’informations sur ce qui précède, veuillez contacter un membre de notre équipe chez Vialto Associés, ou alternativement:\n\nNadine Landry\nAssociée\n\nMelodie Molina\nAssociée\n\nSusan Martyn\nAssociée\n\nDe plus amples informations sur Vialto Partners sont disponibles ici: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners et/ou Vialto Associés (« Vialto ») fait référence aux filiales détenues en propriété exclusive de CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited ainsi qu’aux autres membres du réseau mondial Vialto Partners.

        "date": "December 9, 2024",
        "content": "Global Mobility Tax\n\nSummary\n\nThe April 2024 federal budget proposals to reduce the individual deduction on stock option benefits and increase the capital gains inclusion rate has not yet passed into law. However, two recent announcements from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) confirm that the CRA will administer 2024 employee and employer tax reporting based on the proposals.\n\nThe detail\n\nThe April 2024 budget introduced significant changes to the treatment of stock option benefits and capital gains received by individual taxpayers, together with changes to the tax treatment of capital gains received by corporations.\n\nBefore the changes in the budget, individual taxpayers could claim a 50% deduction on qualifying option benefits and most capital gains. The changes proposed in the budget would restrict this 50% deduction on combined capital gains and stock option income up to $250,000 per year, with such income over this threshold eligible for only a 33% deduction. For 2024, the $250,000 limit applies to income realized on or after June 25, 2024.\n\nDraft legislation to effect the budget proposals was introduced in September 2024 and has not received royal assent. However, two recent updates from the CRA confirm that the Agency will be administering the changes based on the draft legislation.\n\nThe first update announced that the CRA will release updated 2024 tax forms for impacted individuals, trusts, and corporations to reflect the draft legislation. The new forms will be available by January 31, 2025.\n\nThe second update includes instructions for the preparation of 2024 T4 slips for employees who exercised stock options, as follows:\n\nFor options exercised before June 25, 2024, T4 reporting will remain the same as in prior years:\n\nFor options exercised on or after June 25, 2024, new T4 reporting will be:\n\nThe draft legislation and the administrative guidelines indicate that despite the requirement to report a 33% deduction on the T4, an employee would still be eligible for a 50% deduction on the Box 90 option benefit as long as the benefit is below $250,000 and the employee has no other income driving the capital gains inclusion rate into the 66.67% bracket. It is assumed that the remaining deduction will be claimed on the employee’s tax return.\n\nAlthough this CRA guidance regarding T4 preparation is helpful, the release of tax forms at the end of January does not leave much time to review and determine the data that will be required to complete these forms. The changes to the T4 preparation are relatively straightforward, but may be difficult to integrate into existing payroll software systems, particularly given the short time frame to make any necessary system changes.\n\nMore fundamentally, there is no guidance on the withholding rate that employers should apply to option exercises on or after June 25, 2024. The CRA’s intent to administer the budget proposals may be another reason for employers to consider increasing their withholding rates, if they have not already done so, but this is still a nuanced decision that each impacted employer will need to consider.\n\nIt should be noted that there is still a chance that the budget proposals will not pass into law. However, the 2024 employee and employer tax reporting guidance indicates it will be proceeding on this basis.\n\nAnnouncement one\n\nAnnouncement two\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nChelsea Coosemans\nPartner, Toronto\n\nDan Trinh\nPartner, Vancouver\n\nAlex Legg\nDirector, Calgary\n\nGary Li\nDirector, Toronto\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "August 19, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nA new EU regulation harmonises visa regime for the western balkans\n\nSummary\n\nOn 22 July 2024 the European Council adopted a landmark regulation that harmonises the visa regime for the entire Western Balkans. This development represents a significant step toward enhancing regional integration and facilitating easier travel across Europe for citizens of the Western Balkans.\n\nThe detail\n\nThis regulation addresses a longstanding issue that has affected the region for years. Since December 2009, most citizens of the Western Balkans, including those from Serbia, have enjoyed visa-free access to the Schengen area with their biometric passports. However, a notable exception remained – holders of passports issued by the Serbian Coordination Directorate in Belgrade faced additional visa requirements, creating a divide within the region.\n\nRecognizing the need for consistency, the European Commission proposed an amendment in November 2023 to resolve this disparity. The proposal aimed to extend visa-free travel to all Western Balkan citizens, ensuring equal treatment across the region. Following months of careful consideration, the European Council’s recent adoption of this regulation guarantees that all passport holders from the Western Balkans, regardless of the issuing authority, can now travel to the Schengen area without a visa.\n\nSpecific Goals and Expected Outcomes\n\nTaking effect 20 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, this change simplifies entry requirements and enhances mobility throughout the region. This is particularly significant for neighbouring countries like Bulgaria, which is already part of the Schengen area for air and sea travel, with land borders expected to follow soon. The harmonisation of the visa regime will facilitate even smoother cross-border movement, further strengthening economic and social ties.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners Bulgaria point of contact: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nMina Kapsazova\nDirector\n\nEkaterina Arnaudova\nManager\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "title": "Hungary | Immigration | New residence permit type to take effect in 2023",
        "date": "August 14, 2023",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nA new immigration law will take effect in Hungary later this year, leading to possible new immigration options for guest workers from outside the EU/EEA. The new law intends to reduce the processing times and prevent individuals from remaining in Hungary for other purposes either legally or irregularly. There are, however, some issues that are yet to be clarified, such as how the quotas could be monitored by the employers and which nationalities will be eligible.\n\nYou can find our detailed assessment of the changes and possible impact in our publications on Adó Online and Portfolio (both in Hungarian language). Alternatively, we have summarised the relevant changes below.\n\nThe Detail\n\nOn 23 July 2023 a new law came into force in Hungary aiming to further regulate the situation of third-country nationals arriving to Hungary for the purpose of work. Effective as of 1 November 2023, the Act L of 2023 on the Hungarian employment of Guest Workers introduces a new residence permit type that can be applied for by certain third country (i.e. non-EU, non-EEA) nationals under specific circumstances. This alternative route of employing third-country nationals in Hungary intends to facilitate the residence permit application process in cases falling under the category of “guest worker” and at the same time it aims to prevent the holders of the new permit type from remaining in Hungary in the long run.\n\nExisting options\n\nHiring workers from third countries had been an option based on the already existing regulations even before the guest worker residence permit was introduced. The permit that third-country nationals can obtain as per the standard Hungarian regulations in most cases is a combined work and residence permit applied for in a single application process, commonly called as single permit. Since the standard immigration routes remain effective, it is worth examining the differences between the classic single permit and the guest worker residence permit, which – according to the new law – is also a type of single permit.\n\nWhat’s new?\n\nBased on the new regulation, not all third country nationals can be defined as a guest worker. In addition, not all positions are eligible under the regulation. A ministerial decree will announce the list of countries where guest workers could be hired from and the positions that they can fulfil. The overall and per country quotas will also be announced annually in a ministerial decree before the guest worker act becomes effective.\n\nNot all companies in Hungary will be able to opt for hiring a third-country national as a guest worker. Instead, only certain companies will be eligible, such as the strategic partners of the Government, those who implement an investment of preferential status for national economy considerations and a special range of temporary-work agencies.\n\nPractical implications\n\nThere are some important yet unanswered questions regarding the new regulation. It is unclear, for example, how the employers can monitor the status of the annual and per country quotas to know whether they can hire (further) guest workers. The hope is therefore that the ministerial decrees will address this question.\n\nIn addition, there is a more essential question in connection with the new law: can the third-country national and the prospective employer opt for the classic single permit route instead of applying for a guest worker residence permit if the specific requirements of the latter one are met? The relevance of this question is that hiring someone as a guest worker is not necessarily a better option considering all aspects compared to the classic single permit scenario. An advantage of the guest worker residence permit is that the government office is not involved in terms of work authorization during the first application process only in the permit renewal processes, while this is necessary in the “classic” single permit applications in most cases. The decision-making time is not significantly shorter (60 days instead of the general 70 days) but leaving out the government office from the application procedure could reduce the decision-making time in practice. Moreover, there is an alternative and possibly faster way to fulfil the labour market test that can further reduce the time needed for the immigration authority to make the decision.\n\nThe guest worker residence permit can be applied for up to 2 years and can be renewed for an overall 3-year duration counted from the issuance of the first permit. If there is an intention to continue employing the third-country national, it is possible to apply for a new 2-year period guest worker residence permit and renewing it again, however, the same 3-year cap would apply again. However, this is only available for holders of a guest worker residence permit. The classic single permit can be applied for up to 2 years and it can be renewed by 2 years at a time (as a main rule), and, if necessary, other type of residence permits can be applied for during the validity period of a single permit.\n\nAnother disadvantage for the third-country national considered as a guest worker is that the holder cannot apply for a permanent residence permit in Hungary, and family members cannot apply for a residence permit as accompanying family members.\n\nIn addition, the employer has increased responsibility if the third-country national guest worker does not leave the European Union upon the expiry of the guest worker residence permit as the costs of the expulsion, detention and deportation will be payable by the company if the individual does not have the sufficient means to pay these expenses.\n\nWhat this means\n\nIt is clear that the new law intends to reduce the processing times and prevent individuals from remaining in Hungary for other purposes either legally or irregularly. There are, however, some issues that are still to be clarified, such as how the quotas could be monitored by employers and which nationalities will be eligible. Based on this, it will be possible to determine whether this new permit type will be more favourable and more popular than current existing categories for the employers that are eligible to hire guest workers, assuming that they will have the choice for selecting the type of permit to proceed with.\n\nHow we can help\n\nVialto will continue to monitor developments closely and assess the impact on businesses and employees.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n· Dénes Megyesi – Senior Manager – denes.megyesi@vialto.com\n\n· Kata Magyar – Senior Consultant –  kata.magyar@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Australia | Employment Tax | Guidance on contractors now finalised",
        "date": "April 11, 2024",
        "content": "In early 2023 we examined a draft ruling and guideline published by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) on worker classification. The ATO has now officially finalised this guidance through the following:\n\nThe finalised documents are geared towards educating stakeholders on worker classification intricacies whilst offering essential governance measures in the accompanying guidance for employers to adopt.\n\nThe recently finalised ruling aids in understanding the ordinary meaning of an “employee” for the purposes of subsection 12(1) of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 (SGAA). Similar to our commentary on the draft rulings, the finalised rulings still do not provide a definitive answer to the question “is my worker an employee or a contractor?”. Despite that, the finalised guidance released by the ATO offers information for consideration and a compliance framework that organisations can incorporate into their worker classification process.\n\nTR 2023/4 reaffirms several general principles published in the initial draft document. However, notable changes have been introduced in the finalised version, reflecting consideration of numerous submissions received by the ATO and recent case law developments in the field of worker classification. Employers should particularly take note of the following:\n\nThe ATO has complemented the taxation ruling with the PCG offering insights as it outlines a risk framework for employers to adopt ensuring compliance. Whilst the PCG closely aligns with its draft version, the ATO has added additional guidance to assist employers in their worker classification governance framework. In our previous reporting, we outlined five criteria for employers to assess their worker classification risk. Notably, in the updated finalised documents, two new risk criteria have been introduced, being the requirement for a comprehensive written contract and the consideration of the extended definition of “employee per SGR 2005/1”. Organisations therefore need to satisfy all seven of the criteria for an arrangement to be considered very low risk.\n\nThe table below, summarised from PCG 2023/2, provides an overview of the risk levels and criteria for employers to evaluate their risk ratings, noting that if the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract do not fall in the below risk categories, then it will be considered high-risk.\n\nIt is worth noting that despite its title as “Classifying workers as employees or independent contractors”, the ATO reaffirms that the criteria in this guidance is not to be used to determine if a worker is an employee or a contractor. Rather, the finalised guideline outlines the ATO’s compliance approach for businesses that engage workers. Importantly, this provides a framework that employers can use to mitigate their risk of a wrong worker classification as it sets out how the ATO will allocate compliance resources, based on the risks associated with the classification.\n\nThe primary challenge for employers continues to lie in confirming worker classification under both the common law and extended definition of employee per SGAA. The finalised taxation ruling confirms the significance of the written contract when evaluating the nature of a relationship.\n\nHowever, it is also important to note that the employment law landscape is evolving with the enactment of the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023.  Contrary to the guidance provided in Jamsek, Personnel Contracting and TR 2023/4, the Closing Loopholes Bill proposed to reinstate the multifactorial test as the correct approach to characterise a relationship as one of either employment or contractor for Fair Work purposes.  Whilst the Bill did receive royal assent, the originally proposed measures in relation to the definition of “employee”, have been deferred for consideration by Parliament in 2024.\n\nThe disparity between the ATO’s view in TR 2023/4 (which applies for tax and superannuation purposes) and the proposed definition in the Closing Loopholes Bill (which applies for Fair Work purposes) emphasises the importance for employers to correctly classify workers as either employees or contractors. If these measures pass, this may create an administrative and payroll burden for employers, as they now have to navigate two separate definitions of employee versus contractor for different employer obligations.\n\nWe recommend employers follow the ATO guidance and ensure that:\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMaria Ravese\nPartner\n\nKristy Whitnell\nDirector\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit: www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Poland | Migration Strategy — digitalization of residence permit applications",
        "date": "November 21, 2024",
        "content": "On October 15, 2024, the Council of Ministers adopted Poland’s Migration Strategy for 2025–2030, emphasizing a shift toward the digitalization of residence permit applications.\n\nThe Polish Ministry of the Interior and Administration (MSWiA) is working on a draft amendment to the Act on Foreigners, enabling foreign nationals to submit applications for temporary, permanent, and EU long-term residence permits electronically. This aims to streamline the process, address long delays, and align with modern expectations. While technical and logistical challenges remain, this marks a positive development for employers who would benefit from faster and more streamlined processes.\n\nThe draft amendment to the Act on Foreigners introduces transformative changes to Poland’s immigration strategy, with the potential to significantly modernize and streamline residence permit applications. A cornerstone of this reform is the Case Handling Module (MOS) – a digital system enabling foreigners to submit applications electronically. By replacing the current paper-based, in-person process, which often results in delays of 4 to 12 months, MOS aims to address inefficiencies and expedite decision-making.\n\nThe transition to a digital system offers many benefits, including smoother submission processes, integration with national registers, and the automation of certain procedures. However, these promising changes also present challenges that must be addressed to ensure success.\n\nThe current MOS system has significant flaws: it is narrowed to filling out and submitting the application, has character limits, and no functionality for tracking case status, attaching documents, or submitting declarations. Ambiguities in attachment requirements and discrepancies in provincial office practices may further complicate implementation. Standardizing regulations and improving system functionality are critical to the success of these reforms.\n\nMoreover, challenges are anticipated in ensuring that representatives (attorneys) can participate in proceedings. The current MOS system and proposed legislation fail to accommodate representatives in administrative proceedings, despite their role being protected under the Code of Administrative Procedure. Excluding representatives hinders the submission of key documents and limits their influence on cases. Representatives play a crucial role in improving cooperation with authorities, streamlining processes, and easing case handling.\n\nThere are also concerns about digital exclusion, as many foreigners may face difficulties navigating the system due to language barriers or lack of digital access, potentially leading to incorrectly filled-out applications.\n\nThe shift to digital applications represents a major step toward modernizing and improving Poland’s immigration processes. By reducing reliance on paper forms and introducing electronic document workflow, the government hopes to eliminate bureaucratic inefficiencies and ease the burden on both foreign nationals and provincial offices.\n\nHowever, successful implementation will require addressing existing technical issues, such as the MOS system’s limited functionality, and ensuring that all individuals involved in the application process – especially those requiring legal representation – can access and utilize the system effectively. While these changes are necessary for aligning with digital trends, they must be carefully managed to prevent further delays or increased barriers for foreigners navigating the residency application process.\n\nThis transition is expected to grant immigration authorities significantly broader access to data concerning foreign nationals. As a result, ensuring compliance and thoroughly preparing and reviewing each foreign national’s case will become even more critical to facilitate a smooth process for obtaining immigration documents.\n\nVialto Partners can help you adapt to the new immigration requirements and ensure your employees remain compliant with immigration laws, securing both the right to work and stay and supporting business continuity. We can bridge the gap between technological reforms and the practical needs of applicants, ensuring a smoother transition while addressing the challenges posed by digitalization.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nJadwiga Chorązka\nPartner\n\nEmilia Piechota\nImmigration Director\n\nJakub Skrzypek\nImmigration Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Kenya | Highlights of recent amendments to Tax Laws and Tax Procedures",
        "date": "February 13, 2025",
        "content": "Summary\n\nThe Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 2024 (‘’TLAA’’) and The Tax Procedures (Amendment) Act, 2024 (‘’TPAA’’) were assented into law by the president on 11th December 2024. The Acts introduce several amendments to the Kenya tax legislation namely: The Income Tax Act, The Valued Added Tax Act, The Tax Procedures Act, The Excise Duty Act and The Miscellaneous Fees and Levies Act.\n\nThis bulletin provides a high-level employment tax amendments analysis and their potential implications on employers and employees in Kenya.\n\nWorth noting that the amendments herein took effect from 27th December 2024.\n\nThe detail\n\nNon-cash benefits\nThe TLAA amends Section 5(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act to increase the non-cash benefits tax-exempt threshold from KES 36,000 per annum to KES 60,000 per annum. This means that KES 60,000 per annum (KES 5,000 per month) employment non-cash benefits conferred to employees will be tax free.\n\nMeals to employees\nThe TLAA also amends Section 5(4)(f) of the Income Tax Act to increase the tax-free meals amount threshold provided to employees by employers from KES 48,000 per annum to KES 60,000 per annum.\n\nImplications: This is a highly welcome gesture because tax-free amounts have remained unchanged over the years and not being in tandem with the significant fluctuations in the economy. This will somewhat cushion the low-income earners from the harsh economic landscape and the runaway cost of living.\n\nIncreased threshold for allowable pension contributions\n\nThe TLAA amends Section 22A of the Income Tax Act to increase the tax-deductible amount from 240,000 per annum (KES 20,000 per month) to KES 360,000 per annum (KES 30,000 per month) against an employees’ taxable income. This deduction is only applicable pension contributions to a registered pension scheme.\n\nImplications: This new provision increases the amount being saved towards retirement and slightly increases the employees’ disposable income since it is a direct deduction from taxable employment income\n\nTax exemption for pension benefits\n\nThe TLAA now grants tax exemption on pension benefits pay-out to retirees subject to specified rules of respective individual registered retirement pension scheme/provident fund and National Social Security Fund.\n\nThe TLAA tax exemption applies to:\n\nImplications: Increasing the allowable deductions threshold on pension contributions and extends the pension benefits tax fee amount and exemption. This will foster a saving culture and at the same time it incentivizes both employers and employees to actively participate in pension schemes and provided funds savings.\n\nDefinition of individual retirement fund, provident and pension funds\nThe TLAA further amends the Section 2 of the Income Tax Act on definition of individual retirement fund by deleting the registration with the Commissioner of Income Tax requirement.\n\nThe TLAA introduces new definitions of “registered individual retirement fund”, “registered pension fund” and “registered provident fund” to now mean “funds registered with the Retirement Benefits Authority” (RBA).\n\nDeductibility of Social Health Insurance, Post Retirement Medical Fund and Housing Levy contributions\n\nThe TLAA now introduces allowable deductions under Section 15(2) of the Income Tax Act including:\n\nImplications: The deductibility of the contributions mentioned above will some worth reduce employees’ tax base. This will effectively lead to a reduction in the pay as you earn (PAYE) payable by employees and, ultimately increasing employees’ net pay take home.\n\nScrapping of the post-retirement medical relief and Affordable Housing Relief\n\nThe TLAA has subsequently scrapped tax relief towards Affordable Housing and post-retirement medical by repealing Section 30A and 31A respectively.\n\nThe TLAA also amends Section 15(3)(b) of the Income Tax Act to increase the mortgage interest payable threshold on loans from approved and registered financial institutions from KES 300,000 per annum to KES 360,000 per annum. This will apply to loans taken for the purpose of purchasing or improving of a house used for residential purposes.\n\nImplications: This amendment seeks to encourage home ownership by easing the financial burden associated with mortgage interest.\n\nThe Tax Procedures (Amendment) Act, 2024 (‘’TPAA’’) extends the tax amnesty deadline to 30 June 2025. The TPAA further revises the period covered by the tax amnesty to include the periods prior to 31 December 2023.\n\nImplications: Under this amendment, taxpayers who had not paid their principal taxes due before 31 December 2023 can settle these taxes without accruing any penalties or interest if paid by 30 June 2025.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAndrew Ondieki\nDirector\n\nKennedy Kyalo\nSenior Manager\n\nMartin Wambugu\nManager\n\nRitah Lihavi\nAssociate\n\n\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.

        "title": "Switzerland | Remote Work & Employment Tax | Federal council creates legal tax basis for cross-border telework",
        "date": "March 14, 2024",
        "content": "Remote Work & Employment Tax\n\nSwitzerland | Federal Council creates legal tax basis for cross-border telework\n\nSummary\nThe Swiss Federal Council has proposed amendments to the Federal Tax Law and the Tax Harmonisation Act concerning telework for cross-border commuters from Switzerland’s neighboring countries. These changes respond to the evolving landscape of remote work. The proposed legislation provides a legal basis to tax teleworkers in Switzerland even if they are teleworking from their home abroad. There will also be a legal basis which clarifies employer obligations regarding reporting and attestation.\n\nThe detail\nEmployees having their place of residency (center of vital interest) outside of Switzerland whilst working under a Swiss employment contract require physical presence to grant Switzerland the taxation right on the employment income received from a Swiss employer. In practice this means only the working days performed physically in Switzerland would be taxable in Switzerland whilst the days physically worked outside of Switzerland would typically be taxable in the country of residency.\n\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic it became clear that Telework activities will increase. Correspondingly, Switzerland has signed agreements specifically with Italy and France which tackle this topic, and which grant employees the right to telework in their country of residency up to 25% (Italy) and 40% (France) of their total working time without impacting their status as a Cross-Border commuter and also without changing their tax implications.\n\nThe proposed amendments in Swiss Law are designed to adapt taxation laws to accommodate telework situations, ensuring clarity and compliance within the evolving work environment. Importantly, these changes establish a legal framework within the Swiss tax law to tax employees, even if they are physically working abroad (neighboring countries).\n\nA notable change to be introduced into Swiss national Law is regarding the reporting obligations for employers when one of their employees’ transitions to a different employer during the tax year. The former employer will need to attest the number of teleworking days already performed during the year enabling the new employer to obtain information about telework arrangements made earlier in the tax year. This allows for smoother transitions and ensures compliance with relevant agreements while honoring tax obligations.\n\nAlso, the federal council wants to lay down a legal foundation and process regarding the exchange of tax sensitive information between countries according to international tax agreements (automatic exchange of information for teleworking employees).  The information to be exchanged may include information on income, taxes paid, social security paid, teleworking rates, teleworking days, as well as data for identifying the taxable person. The details to the actual process is still to be defined by the Federal Department of Finance.\n\nTakeaway\nThe proposed amendments signify Switzerland’s proactive approach to adapt tax laws to the changing nature of work, particularly in the context of telework and cross-border employment. While focusing on neighboring countries, the legislation sets a precedent for future regulatory adjustments and facilitates cooperation with international partners. These changes aim to strike a balance between ensuring tax compliance and accommodating the evolving work landscape shaped by remote work trends accelerated by the pandemic.\n\nHow we can help\nVialto Partners is specialized in cross-border set ups and supports employers to navigate through the world of global mobility and its evolving legal landscape.

The exemption is set to expire on June 30, 2025, unless renewed by state lawmakers.\n\nOverview\n\nTo incentivize employees to work overtime hours, the Alabama legislature enacted House Bill 217 which excludes wages paid to full-time hourly employees for work performed in excess of 40 hours per week from the state’s definition of gross income and exempts such overtime pay from state income tax for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2024. Currently there is no cap on how much overtime pay is eligible for exemption.\n\nEach employer is required to submit to the Department of Revenue, on forms prescribed by the Department, the following:\n\n• For the tax year beginning January 1, 2023, the total amount received by full-time hourly wage-paid employees as compensation for work performed in excess of 40 hours in a week and the total number of employees for which it was paid. The data is due no later than January 31, 2024.\n\n• For the tax year beginning on or after January 1, 2024, and each tax year thereafter, the total amount received by full-time hourly wage-paid employees as compensation for work performed in excess of 40 hours in a week and the total number of employees for which it was paid. The data shall be provided monthly or quarterly and shall be due no later than the due date for the corresponding monthly or quarterly withholding tax returns.\n\nAdditional information as may be required by the department.\n\nThe exemption is available for tax years that begin after December 31, 2023 and end prior to June 30, 2025.\n\nHow we can help\n\nVialto can assist you in complying with your responsibilities related to the state overtime exemption, including determining which employees are affected, reviewing amounts paid, assisting with any required reporting, and drafting employee communications.\n\nPlease reach out directly to your Vialto contact or one of the individuals listed below to discuss next steps.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n• Tina Schrob, Partner | cristina.g.schrob@vialto.com\n• Greg Fetter, Partner | gregory.fetter@vialto.com\n• Ligeia Donis, Partner | ligeia.m.donis@vialto.com\n• Priya Schwartzburt, Director | priya.c.schwartzburt@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

The information has been confirmed by the European Commission and the new timeline is published in their official website.\n\nThe Change\nETIAS stands for European Travel Information and Authorisation System. It is a digital pre-travel authorisation that gives an individual ‘permission to travel’ to the Schengen zone.\n\nThe revised launch date is now anticipated to be in May 2025. Additional delays may occur if the EES (Entry-Exit-System) is not operational by that time. The expectation is that ETIAS will only enter into operation five to six months after the EES activation.\n\nWhat this means for employees\nVisa free nationals to the Schengen zone will not require an ETIAS until mid-2025. Employers have now more time to prepare for this upcoming change. See our recent alert on the UK’s ETA and EU ETIAS here for a link to our detailed FAQ on this topic.\n\nHow we can help\nThe ETIAS places all administrative and compliance burdens on the traveller, but nevertheless presents risks to employers. Business travel may be disrupted, there is some likelihood that employees assume ETIAS grants a right to work, there will be greater emphasis on days in the Schengen area and a chance of employees being caught out by scams.

        "title": "Qatar | US Adds Qatar to Visa Waiver Program: Key Mobility and Potential Tax Impact",
        "date": "October 2, 2024",
        "content": "Global Mobility Tax\n\nSummary\n\nQatar has been designated as the 42nd member of the U.S. Visa Waiver Program (VWP), allowing its citizens to travel to the United States for tourism or business for up to 90 days without a visa. The changes will take effect no later than December 1, 2024, and will facilitate easier travel between the two nations, though certain business activities may result in U.S. tax considerations for both individuals and companies.\n\nThe detail\n\nQatar has officially joined the U.S. Visa Waiver Program (VWP), making it the first Gulf nation to receive this designation. This decision, made by Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, is expected to significantly enhance security cooperation and facilitate legitimate travel and commerce between the United States and Qatar. As a member of the VWP, Qatari citizens will be able to travel to the U.S. for tourism or business for up to 90 days without needing a visa, starting no later than December 1, 2024.\n\nQatar’s inclusion in the VWP underscores its successful compliance with stringent security requirements set forth by the U.S. government. Key criteria included maintaining a nonimmigrant visa refusal rate below 3%, issuing secure travel documents, and extending reciprocal entry privileges to U.S. citizens and nationals without regard to national origin, religion, ethnicity or gender. The article highlights the extensive efforts made by Qatar to meet these requirements, which involved close collaboration with U.S. law enforcement and counterterrorism agencies.\n\nThe implementation of the VWP will also benefit U.S. citizens traveling to Qatar. Currently enjoying visa-free travel, they will be able to stay in Qatar for up to 90 days starting October 1, 2024, provided they meet specific requirements, such as having a valid passport and a confirmed hotel booking. The Department of Homeland Security will continue to monitor Qatar’s compliance with VWP requirements, ensuring that the partnership remains strong and effective. Overall, Qatar’s entry into the VWP represents a significant step in bolstering U.S.-Qatar relations and improving security cooperation between the two nations.\n\nWhat this means\n\nQatar’s entry into the U.S. Visa Waiver Program marks a historic milestone as the first Gulf nation to achieve this status, strengthening the strategic partnership between the two countries. Effective by December 1, 2024, it simplifies travel for Qatari citizens, promoting economic ties and cultural exchange, while also reflecting Qatar’s commitment to U.S. security standards. This designation enhances cooperation on key issues like counterterrorism and signals growing trust, potentially encouraging other nations to join the program, further bolstering regional security.\n\nIt is important to note that Qatari nationals conducting business or performing work under the VWP in the US may trigger tax obligations depending on the business activities, particularly when providing services or signing contracts that generate U.S. source income. Activities such as marketing, client meetings, or establishing a permanent presence could result in tax liabilities for both individuals and their employers.\n\nAdditionally, the VWP prohibits foreign nationals from working for U.S. entities, performing paid services, or engaging in long-term studies. While certain activities are allowed, activities like negotiating contracts or lobbying are restricted. Foreign employers may also face tax reporting obligations if their employees generate U.S. source income due to the nature of their activities.

        "date": "January 29, 2025",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nThe New Zealand Government has introduced changes to visitor visa rules, effective from 27 January 2025, to allow tourists entering New Zealand on a visitor visa or an NZeTA (New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority) to work remotely for overseas-based employers or engage in overseas-based self-employment while in New Zealand.\n\nThe detail\n\nUntil now, New Zealand’s visitor visa policy prohibited individuals from work, with limited exceptions for specific business activities or other special categories of visitors, regardless of whether an employer was based overseas. When strictly enforced, the policy meant that tourists risked breaching their visitor visa conditions if they needed to check work emails, take calls, or participate in online meetings while holidaying in New Zealand. This longstanding policy issue complicated compliance for visitors wishing to engage in remote work.\n\nFrom 27 January, visitor visa holders may undertake remote work in New Zealand. Remote work is defined as work that:\n\nIt is important to note that travelling to New Zealand solely for the purpose of remote work is not considered a lawful reason for visiting.  However, visitors working remotely while sightseeing or visiting family, is acceptable.\n\nTravelers whose primary purpose is to work remotely in New Zealand must apply for a work visa unless they qualify for a visitor visa under a special category or are undertaking activities for gain or reward that are exempt from obtaining a work visa.  Due to the complexity of special category visitor visas, and other exemptions or ‘carve-outs’, we strongly encourage businesses planning to have remote workers in New Zealand to carefully check their eligibility.\n\nThere may be tax implications for individuals who intend to work remotely in New Zealand. Therefore, it is crucial for overseas businesses and employees to investigate and consider taxation requirements when making plans to work remotely in New Zealand.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nJaq Chong\nDirector, Immigration\n\nKim Gibbs\nManager, Immigration\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "content": "08 February 2023\n\nImpact: Medium\n\nSummary\n\nThe cabinet of ministers has accepted an amendment of the Labor Code bill which implements the 2019/1158 EU directive. The directive is concerned with balancing the private and professional life of parents and caretakers.\n\nThe directive’s aim is to achieve equal job opportunities for men and women by making it easier to balance professional and personal life. The bill is also meant to encourage more equal allocation of parental duties between man and woman.\n\nThe Detail\n\nProtective leave\n\nThe bill introduces 5 days of protective leave, the aim of which is to enable employees to take care of their relatives or people from the same household. This is an unpaid type of leave.\n\nPayment of parent’s benefit\n\nThe bill increases the value of parental benefits from 80% to 81,5% of a standard remuneration.\n\nPaternity leave\n\nThe period in which paternity leave can be used will be shortened from 24 months to 12 months. Where parental leave is not used within that time frame it will be canceled.\n\nParental leave\n\nEach parent has the exclusive right to 9 weeks of parental leave. This right cannot be transferred to the other employee – the child’s parent. An allowance of 70% of the calculation basis will be granted to the parent for the leave period.\n\nThe right for parental leave and employment status\n\nThe entitlement to parental leave will no longer depend on the mother’s employment status, and social security contributions paid within on the day of childbirth.\n\nOvertime in workplace and child up the age of 8\n\nUnder the new bill, parents of children up to the age of 8 can work overtime, night shifts, intermittent working time and be required to work outside of their normal place of work only if they consent to do so. Previously this provision only applied to parents of children under 4 years of age.\n\nLeave due to force majeure\n\nThe bill introduces force majeure leave which will enable employees to use it whenever an urgent situation, such sickness or accident occurs. The bill provides for 2 days (16 hours) leave. During this period the employee is entitled to 50% of salary for the absence.\n\nContact:\n\nWe encourage you to contact our experts if you have any questions.:\n● Mariusz Ignatowicz, Partner Director | mariusz.ignatowicz@vialto.com\n● Jadwiga Chorązka, Managing Director | jadwiga.chorazka@vialto.com\n● Joanna Narkiewicz-Tarłowska, Director | joanna.narkiewicz-tarlowska@vialto.com\n● Grzegorz Ogórek, Senior Manager | grzegorz.ogorek@vialto.com\nMore information about Vialto Partners can be found at this link: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Sweden | Adoption of the new EU Blue Card Directive",
        "date": "February 6, 2025",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nStarting from 1 January 2025, requirements for an EU Blue Card issued in Sweden have been eased. This includes a lower salary threshold and removing the requirement to leave Sweden when applying for an EU Blue Card in-country. This is following implementation of the recast EU Blue Card Directive into national law.\n\nThe details\n\nIn September 2024, the Swedish government submitted a bill to the Riksdag with proposals aimed to enhance Sweden’s ability to attract and retain high-skilled workers. This is an area of great focus for Swedish policymakers as the Swedish labour market is familiar to the issues that are prevalent on the EU labour market as a whole, in which skills shortages and an ageing population are amongst some of the key concerns.\n\nAs a result of the bill, in November 2024, the Riksdag decided to implement the European Union’s new Blue Card-directive, which effectively replaces the old Directive which was introduced in 2009. The EU Blue Card is a combined residence and work permit for highly qualified professionals from outside the EU who have an employment in Sweden. This type of work permit is an important keystone in the strategy to attract high-skilled immigrant labour. The new EU Blue Card-Directive was effectively implemented in Sweden on January 1st, 2025.\n\nBelow are some of the key policy changes that entered legal force in Sweden on January 1st, 2025.\n\n\n\nThe salary threshold to apply for an EU-Blue Card in Sweden is lowered: The minimum salary requirement is reduced from 1.5 times to 1.25 times the average gross salary in Sweden. Effectively, today’s salary requirement amounts to 49 875 SEK (Swedish Krona) per month. Failure to meet the salary requirement will lead to a rejection of the application. The salary amount will be updated on an annual basis.\n\nShorter employment duration: The required minimum employment period prior to being eligible to apply for an EU Blue Card is reduced from 12 months to 6 months.\n\nFlexible job transitions in the Swedish labour market: Cardholders can switch to another highly qualified job that meets the EU Blue Card requirements without submitting a new application to the Swedish Migration Agency. Instead, any employment changes must be reported to the Swedish Migration Agency.\n\nImproved flexibility when changing permit grounds in Sweden: Individuals with other types of residence permits in Sweden can now apply for an EU Blue Card without leaving the country. As a general rule, the Swedish Aliens Act states that all applications for a Swedish residence permit must be approved prior to entry. Exemptions to this rule do apply and the EU Blue Card is now a part of the exemption list.\n\nAccording to statistics from the Swedish government in September 2024, the EU Blue Card has only represented a very small number of applications and approved permits based on work in Sweden. With the implementation of the new EU directive, Swedish policymakers are hopeful that the new effective changes will have a positive impact on the attractiveness of applying for an EU Blue Card in Sweden.\n\nFirst, with the new policy changes, holders can enjoy more flexibility in the Swedish labour market. The ability to change employment in Sweden without submitting a new work permit application to the Swedish Migration Agency allows beneficiaries to explore the Swedish labour market without the complexity of filing a new permit application. In addition, being able to transition from a national work permit to an EU Blue Card from within Sweden, allows greater stability for both the employee and the employer as it minimises any potential interruptions to the employment caused by a temporary departure from Sweden.\n\nSecond, the lower salary threshold and reduced employment period (to 6 months) for being eligible to apply will result in a larger work pool being qualified to apply for an EU Blue Card in Sweden. Whether this will result in an actual increase in the number of EU Blue Card applications to the Swedish Migration Agency, remains to be seen.\n\nThird, a more streamlined policy framework helps Swedish employers when they have to turn to international recruitments due to a skill shortage in the local labour market. Simplifying regulations for skilled labour coming from third countries is important for Sweden’s international competitiveness.\n\nSince the new policies were only introduced in January 2025, their short-term and long-term effect on labour market immigration to Sweden are yet to be determined.\n\nHow can we help?\n\nThe policy changes bring significant updates for both new applicants and existing EU Blue Card-holders. In order to retain and attract high-skilled labour, employers must stay informed about legislative changes as navigating the Swedish work permit system can be a complex task.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nPatrik Nyström\nSenior Manager\n\nIda Eriksson\nSenior Associate\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "title": "Netherlands | Social Security | Importance of cross-border remote work agreements between employer and employee for multi-state rules",
        "date": "February 29, 2024",
        "content": "Social Security\n\nNetherlands | Importance of cross-border remote work agreements between employer and employee for multi-state rules\n\nSummary\nAt the end of last year, the Dutch Court (the Central Board of Appeal) set forth its judgment in the case of a German employee who worked remotely from the Netherlands for her German employer. The Dutch Court ruled that, since the cross-border remote work activities were not agreed between employer and employee and were not included in the employment contract, the multi-state rules were not applicable. As a result, the employee was covered in Germany (based on the main rule of EU Regulation 883/2004) since Germany had to be considered the main work location.\n\nAlthough this is a local Dutch judgment, it does provide insight into the application of the multi-state rules of the EU Regulation and the importance of making clear and upfront agreements with employees in view of cross-border remote work activities.\n\nThe Detail\n\nFacts and circumstances\nThe case concerns a German employee who was living in Germany and employed by a German employer. The employee was permitted by the employer to partially work from home in Germany (1 / 2 days per week) and she worked the remainder of her time at the office in Germany.\n\nShe stayed with her partner in the Netherlands from May 2019 (while keeping her apartment in Germany and other ties to Germany) and started working two days per week from the Netherlands during 2019. On 1 January 2020, she permanently moved to the Netherlands. She has reported ill per 20 January 2020 and did effectively not perform any employment activities for the German employer after that date.\n\nMulti-state rules\nIn the judgment, the Court first looks into the residency position and confirms that the employee should be considered as a German resident up to 31 December 2019 and as a Dutch resident as of 1 January 2020.\n\nSubsequently, the Court focuses on the question whether the employee can be considered to carry out work normally in two or more Member States within the meaning of EC Regulation 883/2004, Article 13 (multi-state workers). Based on recent EU case-law1 this condition assumes that the person habitually carries out significant work in the territory of two or more Member States.\n\nIt is important for the application of the multi-state rules that there is a work pattern agreed to a certain extent on a structural basis with the employer (whether explicitly or not). The European Court has indicated that this condition is only met if the employer has, expressly or tacitly, agreed to working from home from another Member State. The employer’s consent may be evident from the employment contract or from a later document (e.g. an individual agreement or annex to the employment contract). For tacit consent, it must be unmistakable from the totality of facts and circumstances that there is conscious consent from the employer. If working in two or more Member States is common within the company, conscious consent may be considered more likely. Without this consent from the employer, the European Court was of the opinion that there is insufficient justification for deviating from the main rule.\n\nApplication to the German employee\nIn the respective case of the German employee, the employee did not request consent from the employer for her cross-border remote work activities in the Netherlands. She did receive consent from the employer for working from home in Germany, but did not inform the German employer on her intention to work from home in the Netherlands. Her employment contract did also not cover work activities performed outside of Germany. Within the German organization, no other employees performed remote work activities outside of Germany.\n\nBased on the above, the Dutch Court ruled that the German employer had not expressly nor tacitly agreed that the employee could perform her activities remotely from the Netherlands.\n\nAs a result, the Dutch Court is of the opinion that the employee cannot be considered to carry out work in more than one Member State within the meaning of Article 13. The main work location of the employee was Germany and as such, based on the main rule of the EU Regulation, she was covered by the German social security scheme.\n\nTakeaway\nThe judgment of the Dutch Court gives a practical insight into the importance of making clear and upfront agreements between employer and employee on cross-border remote work activities, in order for the multi-state rules to apply. Such an agreement may be decisive, also in cases where it is rather clear that the employee in fact works in two Member States. Ideally, these agreements have to be laid down in employment contracts in combination with a policy document, so that the employer’s consent for the remote work activities is clear. Without consent from the employer, it may be argued that the multi-state rules do not apply for these types of activities.\n\nWe therefore recommend ensuring sufficient communication with employees in view of cross-border remote work policies and implications of cross-border work for social security.\n\nHow can we help?\nVialto Partners are assisting large and small businesses across the EU/EEA in designing remote work policies.

The grossed-up monetary value comprises the net value of the benefit received by the employee and the related tax due on the benefit shouldered and paid for by the employer on behalf of the employee.

        "title": "Germany | Subject-to-tax of overtime payments according to the Double Tax Agreement (DTA) Germany/Luxembourg",
        "date": "October 28, 2024",
        "content": "Global Mobility Tax\n\nSummary\n\nOvertime pay is under certain conditions not subject to taxation in Luxembourg. This means that the actual non-taxed income falls under the subject-to-tax clause of Article 22 (1) (f) (aa) of the Germany/Luxembourg double taxation agreement (DTA) and the right of taxation falls back to Germany, if Germany is the country of residence for the taxpayer.\n\nThe detail\n\nThe German Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) circular dated January 15, 2024 published the consultation agreement concluded between Germany and Luxembourg on January 11, 2024 for the uniform application and interpretation of the German/Luxembourg double taxation agreement in the version of the protocol of amendment dated July 6, 2023 (see newsletter article March 2024).\n\nThe consultation agreement also contains information on the subject-to-tax clause under Article 22 (1) (f) (aa) of the DTA Germany/Luxembourg. According to this, the income can only be exempted from taxation in the country of residence, Germany, if it is actually taxed in Luxembourg.\n\nIncome or portions of income that are included in the total amount of income in the respective contracting state on which tax is paid, are deemed to be actually taxed.\n\nIncome or portions of income that are only partially taxed or not taxed at all in the respective treaty state due to the application of a tax-free allowance, income-related expenses or loss carryforwards are also considered actually taxed. Surcharges for Sunday, holiday or night work that are paid in addition to the basic gross wage are also considered actually taxed, provided that their total amount does not exceed the basic gross wage in a calendar year.\n\nOn the other hand, however, wages paid for overtime are not actually taxed in Luxembourg and are therefore fully exempt from income tax. Thus, the fallback clause applies to these wages and the right of taxation reverts to Germany if Germany is the taxpayer’s country of residence.\n\nIn a decree dated April 15, 2024, the Rhineland-Palatinate State Office for Taxes clarifies that the statements in the consultation agreement are purely clarifications and that even before the Protocol of Amendment of July 6, 2023 came into force, Luxembourg and Germany assumed that certain items of income that are not actually taxed in Luxembourg fell under the subject-to-tax clause. This included overtime pay. Therefore, in the opinion of the tax authorities the regulation was already applicable before the consultation agreement came into force\n\nGlobal Mobility Tax\n\nZusammenfassung\n\nÜberstundenvergütungen unterliegen unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen in Luxemburg nicht der Besteuerung. Damit fallen die tatsächlich nicht besteuerten Einkünfte unter die Rückfallklausel des Artikel 22 Abs. 1 Buchstabe f) Doppelbuchstabe aa) des Doppelbesteuerungsabkommens (DBA) Deutschland/Luxemburg und das Besteuerungsrecht fällt an Deutschland zurück, wenn Deutschland der Ansässigkeitsstaat des Steuerpflichtigen ist.\n\nIm Detail\n\nMit BMF-Schreiben vom 15.01.2024 wurde die zwischen Deutschland und Luxemburg abgeschlossene Konsultationsvereinbarung vom 11.01.2024 zur einheitlichen Anwendung und Auslegung des DBAs Deutschland/Luxemburg in der Fassung des Änderungsprotokolls vom 06.07.2023 veröffentlicht (siehe Newsletterbeitrag März 2024). Die Konsultationsvereinbarung enthält auch Ausführungen zur Rückfallklausel nach Artikel 22 Abs. 1 Buchstabe f) Doppelbuchstabe aa) des DBAs Deutschland/Luxemburg. Demnach sind Einkünfte im Ansässigkeitsstaat Deutschland nur steuerfrei zu stellen, wenn diese in Luxemburg tatsächlich besteuert werden.\n\nAls tatsächlich besteuert gelten Einkünfte oder Teile von Einkünften, die im jeweiligen Vertragsstaat in den Gesamtbetrag der Einkünfte einbezogen werden, auf den in diesem Staat Steuern entrichtet werden.\n\nAls tatsächlich besteuert gelten auch Einkünfte oder Teile von Einkünften, die im jeweiligen Vertragsstaat durch Anwendung eines Freibetrages, von Werbungskosten oder Verlustvorträgen nur teilweise oder gar nicht besteuert werden. Als tatsächlich besteuert gelten auch Zuschläge für Sonntags-, Feiertags- oder Nachtarbeit, die neben dem Grundbruttolohn gezahlt werden soweit diese in einem Kalenderjahr in ihrer Summe den Grundbruttolohn nicht übersteigen.\n\nAls tatsächlich nicht besteuert gelten hingegen die Löhne, die für Überstunden gezahlt werden, die in Luxemburg vollständig einkommensteuerfrei sind. Für diese kommt somit die Rückfallklausel zur Anwendung und das Besteuerungsrecht fällt an Deutschland zurück, wenn Deutschland der Ansässigkeitsstaat des Steuerpflichtigen ist.\n\nDas Landesamt für Steuern Rheinland-Pfalz stellt in einer Verfügung vom 15.04.2024 klar, dass es sich bei den Ausführungen in der Konsultationsvereinbarung um eine reine Klarstellungen handele und bereits vor Anwendungsbeginn des Änderungsprotokolls vom 06.07.2023 Luxemburg und Deutschland davon ausgingen, dass bestimmte Einkunftsteile, die in Luxemburg nicht tatsächlich besteuert werden, unter die Rückfallklausel fielen. Hierzu zählten auch die Überstundenvergütungen. Daher sei nach Ansicht der Finanzverwaltung die Regelung schon vor Inkrafttreten der Konsultationsvereinbarung anwendbar.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMathias Schmitt\nPartner\n\nDamaris Besenreuther\nSenior Manager\n\nSina Kunzweiler\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Uruguay | Tax | Uruguay approves certain regulations of the new Social Security Regime",
        "date": "August 17, 2023",
        "content": "9 de agosto de 2023\n\nResumen\n\nComo se recordará, el viernes 28 de abril 2023 el Parlamento uruguayo aprobó la Ley 20.130, conocida como “Reforma a la Seguridad Social”, la cual fue promulgada por el Poder Ejecutivo el día 2 de mayo y publicada en el Diario Oficial el día 10 de mayo.\n\nAlgunas de sus disposiciones entraron a regir este 1 de agosto 2023, y en este contexto, el Poder Ejecutivo aprobó los decretos 227, 228, 229, 230, 231 y 232 el día 31 de Julio de 2023, reglamentarios de algunas disposiciones.\n\nResumimos a continuación los principales temas incluidos en esta reglamentación.\n\nEn detalle\n\nEl Decreto 227/23 reglamenta las disposiciones relativas a funcionarios militares y policiales. Entre otras medidas, se establece como determinar el sueldo básico jubilatorio (SBJ) en estos casos y cuándo aplicaría la causal de pensión por acto directo de servicio y las condiciones del derecho y la asignación de la pensión correspondiente.\n\nEl Decreto 229/23 reglamenta todos los cambios al régimen de pensiones de sobrevivencia, es decir, causales, condiciones y procedimiento a seguir. Es de mencionar que esto podría aplicar en casos de viudez, concubinato, divorciados, o también pensiones para hijos o para padres, en ciertos casos de imposibilidad de trabajar o dependencia económica. El decreto viene a regular los conceptos en cada caso, ya que, desde este 1 de agosto, las causales y el procedimiento de cálculo sufrieron modificaciones relevantes.\n\nPor su parte, el Decreto 230/23 otorga mayores detalles para el cálculo del SBJ, que se tomará en consideración para el cálculo de los haberes jubilatorios, clarificando lo que sucede cuando no existan veinte años completos de aportación. En este sentido, cabe recordar que, como regla general, el SBJ se determinará como el promedio mensual actualizado de las asignaciones computables de los veinte años de mayores asignaciones computables. Asimismo, dicho decreto reglamenta el subsidio por incapacidad, total o parcial.\n\nEl Decreto 231/023 regula la compatibilidad entre jubilación y actividad remunerada, lo que representa un cambio sustantivo para el mercado laboral uruguayo. En resumen, se amplía significativamente la opción de realizar algunas actividades remuneradas, en determinadas condiciones, aún cuando la persona ya se encuentre en goce de su jubilación. La casuística es compleja, ya que aún se mantienen algunas incompatibilidades entre regímenes de actividad, por lo que deberá realizarse un análisis caso a caso para concluir si la opción está permitida o no.\n\nEl Decreto 232/023 reglamenta los diferentes elementos del llamado pilar cero de esta reforma (pilar no contributivo), en particular, el subsidio de asistencia a la vejez, las prestaciones no contributivas por vejez e invalidez, y el suplemento solidario creado por esta reforma. Todo ello, previsto para ciertas situaciones consideradas de vulnerabilidad o de ingresos en franjas menores.\n\nEl Decreto 228/023, que contine disposiciones de diversos capítulos de la ley. En particular, se reglamenta el artículo 3 numeral 6 de la Ley, el cual estableció que las personas que se trasladen a realizar actividades remuneradas fuera del país en calidad de dependientes – ”outbounds”, mantendrán su afiliación cuando se trate de traslados por períodos inferiores a 183 días, siempre que no resulte de aplicación un régimen de traslado temporal al amparo de un Convenio Internacional de Seguridad Social. Mas aún, tratándose de períodos superiores, se podrá optar por mantener la relación jurídica de seguridad social nacional, con las correspondientes obligaciones y derechos, por el período continuo o alternado máximo de cinco años. Se establecen las condiciones y plazos para realizar esta opción, y se clarifica que se permitirá la exclusión del Sistema Nacional Integrado de Salud en ciertos casos.\n\nSe incluyen, además, entre otros, disposiciones relevantes para las personas que habían hecho uso de la conocida “opción del artículo 8 de la Ley 16.713”, se establecen condiciones para solicitar la inclusión de servicios anteriores al 1 de abril de 1996, normas sobre el tipo de documentación a presentar y el vencimiento para ello.\n\nPosteriormente este decreto implementa la nueva metodología y condiciones para el régimen especial para trabajadores de embajadas y consulados en Uruguay.\n\nAdicionalmente, se establece que quienes al 1o de agosto de 2023 se encuentren desarrollando actividades alcanzadas por el presente Decreto, o aquellos que hayan desarrollado actividades alcanzadas por el mismo y cesado éstas, podrán denunciar los servicios previos que pretendan computar, siempre que lo hagan dentro del plazo de un año. Se crea un régimen de facilidades de pago para esta regularización de aportes.\n\n¿Cómo podemos ayudar?\n\nNuestro equipo de Vialto Partners está a su disposición para asesorar a nuestros clientes en los efectos prácticos de estos cambios propuestos, en caso de que lo requiera.\n\nContáctenos\n\nPara cualquier consulta por este u otros temas relativos a Uruguay, por favor no dude en contactar a Vialto Partners:\n\nPuede encontrar más información de Vialto Partners en el siguiente enlace: www.vialtopartners.com\n\n9 August 2023\n\nSummary\n\nAs we have previously informed, the Uruguayan Congress approved on April 28th , 2023, Law 20.130, also known as the “New Social Security Regime”, which was passed by the Executive Power on May 2nd, and published in the Official Gazette on May 10th, 2023.\n\nSome of the changes approved by Law 20.130 entered into force on August 1st, 2023, and as such, the Executive Power issued Decrees 227, 228, 229, 230, 231 and 232 on July 31st, 2023, regulating some relevant changes.\n\nWe summarize below the main topics included in these regulations approved.\n\nIn detail\n\nDecree 227/023 regulates the clauses relative to military force and police workers. Among other measures, this Decree establishes how to determine the Basic Retirement Salary (BRS) in these cases and when would the special severance payment would apply for obtaining a pension, referencing the case where the person dies in the job.\n\nDecree 229/23 regulates all changes to the survivor’s pension, including conditions, eligibility, and procedure to be followed. It should be noted that this could apply to widows, divorced, concubinage and some pensions for children or parents, where there is a proven disability or economic dependence. This decree establishes the concepts applicable to each scenario, since as from August 1st, 2023, the calculation and procedure of survivor’s pension was modified.\n\nDecree 230/23 provides more details for the calculation of BRS, explaining what to be considered, clarifying what happens when the person does not have twenty complete years of contributions. Please remember that as a rule, the BRS will be determined as the monthly updated average of computable salary, of the twenty years of highest computable salary. On other matters, this decree also regulates the subsidy to be paid in cases of disability, total or partial.\n\nDecree 231/023 regulates the compatibility rules between retirement and labor activities, which represents a substantial change in the labor Uruguayan market. Summarizing, the option to work after retirement already existed in Uruguay, but very limited in practice. Law 20.130 significantly extended the permitted scenarios, and this Decree regulates even more the conditions to be fulfilled. There are still some incompatibilities, thus, a case-by-case analysis needs to be performed to know whether the option is applicable or not.\n\nDecree 232/023 regulates the different elements of the so called “Pilar 0” of this reform (elements that persons can receive without having made the corresponding social security contributions), particularly, the subsidy available for old age, disability, the solidarity premium introduced by this reform. All of this has been established to consider the situations of vulnerability or extremely low income.\n\nDecree 228/023, that contains regulation for different chapters of the Law. It is regulated the article 3 number 6 of the law, which establishes that individuals transferred from Uruguay to abroad, as dependent employees – “outbounds”, will keep their affiliation to Uruguayan social security scheme provided the assignment is for less than 183 days, and assuming there is no Certificate of Coverage obtained under a Bilateral Social Security agreement. Moreover, where the assignment is for a period greater than 183 days, the individual could elect to keep social security scheme in Uruguay, with the corresponding liabilities and wrights, for a period of maximum 5 years, interrupted or not. The conditions for this and the timeframe to be considered is clearly established in the Decree, and it is noted that in some cases the individual may elect to be exempt from the health contribution in Uruguay.\n\nAmong other topics, the Decree also includes rules for people that had elected for the known option of “article 8 Law 16.713”, rules for requesting the inclusion of services rendered before April 1st , 1996, rules about the type of documentation and type of proof to be filed, and the due dates for it.\n\nThe decree also implements new methodology and conditions for employees working in Uruguay for an Embassy or a Consulate.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that individuals who are currently performing activities subject to this Decree, or individuals who ceased those, can claim the services rendered if they do it before July 31st, 2024. In other words, a special regime is created for paying social security late debts, with the purpose of encouraging the self-declaration in a one-year timeframe.\n\nHow we can help\n\nThe Vialto Partners team is entirely at disposal to assist the clients with regards to the practical impacts of the changes.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, or any other query regarding Uruguay, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "March 21, 2023",
        "content": "14.03.2023\n\nImmigration\n\nImpact High\n\nSummary\n\nSince February 1st, 2023, Swiss immigration law* has been amended and simplified. Some work permit application types are no longer subject to the approval of the State Secretariat for Migration’s (Swiss Federal Immigration Authority, SEM) resulting to accelerated processing time. The list of the applications which are now subject to the SEM’s approval is exhaustive and shorter than previously. Apart from the listed cases subject to federal approval, the cantonal labour market authorities (LMAs) “may” – no longer “must” – submit prior decisions to the SEM for approval to assess whether the conditions laid down by federal law are met.\n\nThe Detail\n\nIn Switzerland and in particular for Non-EU nationals, work permit applications basically involve three immigration authorities which result in rather long processing time. In practice, processing times can take from 8 to 12 weeks after submission of the application with the competent authorities. Processing times vary from one canton to another and from one application to another. With this change of legislation, the Swiss Federal Council shortened the list of applications which need to be approved by the SEM.\n\nWith effect 1st February 2023, only below cases for gainful activity are automatically subject to SEM’s approval (note the law lists other scenarios (e.g. extensions, etc)) :\n\n1. the exercise of a self-employed activity\n2. the gainful activity of foreign nationals with a degree from a Swiss university if it is of predominant scientific or economic interest (for so-called Clause Neirynck)\n3. the gainful activity of recognised personalities in the scientific, cultural or sporting fields\n4. the gainful activity of persons with special professional knowledge or skills, if their admission meets a proven need.\n5. the gainful activity of crew members of a Swiss company’s inland navigation vessel, if there is a proven need for their admission\n6. Assignments / Secondments of service providers\n7. the gainful activity of persons providing religious instruction or guidance or teaching the language and culture of their country of origin\n8. stays with gainful employment in the context of aid and development projects carried out in the context of economic and technical cooperation\n9. trainings for au-pairs placed by a recognised organisation.\n\nShould an application for a Non-EU national not fall under one of the constellations mentioned above, then, in principle, no SEM’s approval is required. This has a high impact especially for employers wishing to hire non-EU nationals be it on a local Swiss employment contract or even for intercompany transfers of managers or essential specialists.\n\nThis change of law should likely result in smoother and faster processing times, saving up to two to three weeks according to the immigration authorities’ official statement, depending on the competent canton. Businesses can therefore plan their relocation plans for non-EU nationals accordingly and onboard Non-EU new hires more quickly.\n\n\n\n* SR 142.201.1 Verordnung des EJPD über das ausländerrechtliche Zustimmungsverfahren, ZV-EJPD / RS 142.201.1 Ordonnance du DFJP concernant l’approbation, OA-DFJP/ RS 142.201.1 Ordinanza del DFGP concernente l’approvazione, OA-DFGP\n\nHow we can help\n\nPlease do reach out to your Vialto Partners contact should you have any questions on the above.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nOn 12 December 2024, the Council of the European Union agreed to allow Bulgaria and Romania to become full members of the Schengen Area as of 1 January 2025. As a result, border checks will be removed for those travelling between other Schengen countries and Bulgaria and Romania.\n\nThe detail\n\nSince 1 April 2024, Bulgaria and Romania have been partially integrated into the Schengen Area, with border checks being retained only at their land borders. Following the decision by member states in the Council of the European Union, these border checks will gradually be removed from 1 January 2025. This step is following initial proposals from the European Commission that from 2011 and is a significant milestone, highlighting a shared commitment to deeper European integration.\n\nBorder with Greece\n\nFrom 1 January 2025, all land border checks with Greece will be removed. Travellers will enjoy free passage, with only occasional ad hoc checks.\n\nBorder with Austria and Hungary\n\nA transition period will apply for the first 6 months of 2025. While most checks will be eased, some will remain in place as part of an agreement with Austria. This compromise means there will be partial controls between Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary during the initial transition period.\n\nGiven the recent temporary reintroduction of border controls by some member states, including Germany and the Netherlands, it is possible that the transition period could be extended beyond the initial 6 months.\n\nWhat this means\n\nSeamless mobility\n\nInternal border checks will be completely eliminated, enabling unrestricted travel for citizens, residents, and visitors across the Schengen member states.\n\nEconomic advantages\n\nBulgarian and Romanian businesses will benefit from faster goods transportation, optimized logistics, and reduced operational costs, boosting their competitiveness in the European markets.\n\nStronger EU alignment\n\nThe decision reinforces both countries’ commitment to meeting the European standards, paving the way for more extensive cooperation within the EU.\n\nThis decision is more than a procedural milestone—it represents a crucial step towards greater unity and integration within the EU. By becoming full members of the Schengen Area, Bulgaria and Romania are not only strengthening their ties with Europe but also unlocking new opportunities for growth, mobility, and collaboration.\n\nVialto Partners will continue to monitor developments.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMina Kapsazova\nDirector\n\nEkaterina Arnaudova\nManager\n\nIrina Alexandra Marinescu \nManaging Director\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Germany | Tax | Employment Tax Update",
        "date": "February 28, 2023",
        "content": "January 2023\n\nSince some changes have arisen in the wage tax law at the beginning of the tax year 2023, we have compiled a brief overview of the most important reforms for employers to be kept up-to-date.\n\nIncreased commuting allowance\n\nWith retroactive effect from 01.01.2022, the Federal Government has decided to increase the commuting allowance within the framework of the Tax Relief Act 2022. From the 21st distance kilometre, a flat rate of EUR 0.38 per full kilometre applies (up to 20 km still EUR 0.30). This measure was originally planned from 2024, but was brought forward to 2022 and applies accordingly for 2023.\nFor the employer, the increase has an impact on the wage tax flat rate for allowances for journeys between home and the first place of work. If the employer reimburses the costs of family journeys home in the case of double household tax-free in the amount of the distance allowance, the increased amounts can be taken into account here.\n\nBasic tax-free allowance\n\nEvery employee is entitled to an income tax-free amount, the so-called subsistence minimum. For 2023, it will be raised by EUR 561 to EUR 10,908.\n\nIncrease of the official non-cash remuneration values\n\nMeals which are provided to employees free of charge or at a reduced price on each working day are to be valued at the (pro rata) official non-cash remuneration value according to the Social Security Remuneration Ordinance (Sozialversicherungsentgeltverordnung, SvEV). Accordingly, the value for\nmeals granted from calendar year 2023 onwards is,\n\na) for a lunch or dinner 3.80 euros,\n\nb) for a breakfast 2.00 euros.\n\nIn the case of full board (breakfast, lunch and dinner), the meals are to be assessed at a value of 9.60 euros.\n\nThe employer may tax the imputed income at a flat rate of 25% (plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge and, if applicable, flat-rate church tax).\n\nSince 01.01.2023, the monthly non-cash benefit value for free or reduced-price accommodation is 265 EUR.\n\nSolidarity surcharge\n\nThe exemption limit of previously EUR 16,956 will be raised to EUR 17,543 in 2023.\n\nTax treatment of travel expense reimbursements\n\nAs of 1 January 2023, the lump sums for the daily allowance and for accommodation costs for business-related trips abroad have been increased. The current amounts can be found in the overview of the applicable lump sums in the BMF letter dated 23 November 2022 (IV C 5 – S 2353/19/10010 :004).\n\nAllowance for relocation expenses\n\nIn the case of a job-related change of residence, the employer may reimburse the costs incurred by the employee tax-free to the extent that they are deductible as income-related expenses. As a rule, the actual moving costs can be deducted as income-related expenses up to the maximum amount\nthat could be paid as a reimbursement of moving costs according to the Federal Moving Costs Act (Bundesumzugskostengesetz, BUKG) and the Ordinance on the Reimbursement of Moving Costs for Foreign Moves (Verordnung über die Umzugskostenvergütung bei Auslandsumzüge, AUV).\n\nAccording to the new version of the Wage Tax Guidelines 2023, with regard to return relocation costs from abroad to Germany, an approach of 100% of the flat rates is permitted, and no longer 80% of the flat rates, as was previously applicable. This applies to all moves that take place from the tax year 2023 onwards.\n\nInflation compensation premium\n\nThe premium can be voluntarily paid out by the employer to employees free of tax and social security contributions in the amount of EUR 3,000.\n\nThe benefit period is limited in time. It starts on 26 October 2022 and runs until 31 December 2024. It is a one-time tax allowance that cannot be claimed for every year. Nevertheless, the premium can be paid out in several instalments. The premium applies to one employment relationship at a time – thus it can be granted several times in the benefit period in the event of a change of employer.\n\nHowever, the tax exemption of the inflation compensation premium is subject to one condition: The bonus is to be granted in addition to the wages owed anyway.\n\nHome office-lump sum / Working room\n\nTaxpayers who do not have a working room can deduct a home office allowance of EUR 6 per day for each working day at home up to a maximum of EUR 1,260 per year (= 210 days).\n\nIn the case of a working room that forms the centre of the entire business and professional activity, the taxpayer has the right to choose. If the actual expenses amount to less than 1,260 euros, the deduction of the annual flat rate of 1,260 euros is also possible. In this case, no proof of the cost incurred is required – the deduction thus corresponds to the amount of the home office lump sum.\n\nIf the home office is not the centre of business and professional activity, the annual flat rate of 1,260 euros will be deductible in future.\n\nA tax-free reimbursement by the employer continues to be excluded.\n\nNew Wage Tax Guidelines 2023 – changes regarding the application of the daily Wage Tax Table\n\nWithin the amendment of the Wage Tax Guidelines from 2015 by the federal government, there are some significant changes. In particular, the adjustment made in R 35b.5 para. 2 LStR requires critical attention.\n\nSpecifically, the regulation contains the view of the tax authorities on how to deal with cases of temporary taxation of wages in payroll accounting. The previous R 39b.5 para. 2 sentence 3 LStR provided for the application of the wage tax monthly table if the salary was paid monthly. According to the clear wording of the law, the decisive factor for the application of the wage tax table is the wage payment period. As of 1 January 2023, the application of the daily wage tax table is now planned. According to this (R 39b.5 para. 2 sentence 4 LStR 2023), “working days on which the employee received wages that are not subject to domestic wage tax deduction” (e.g. employment in Germany on a daily basis, drawing of tax-free wages according to a double taxation agreement) are no longer to be considered.\n\nThe consequence of this regulation is the higher tax burden, which should lead to a correct taxation according to the so-called benefit principle.\n\nForeign activity decree\n\nThe Foreign Activities Decree regulates the waiver of taxation of wages with respect to certain favoured activities performed abroad, provided that no double taxation treaty exists with that country (e.g. factories, constructions, commissioning of assets and exploitation of natural resources).\n\nThe Foreign Activities Decree has been revised with effect from the 2023 assessment period. The new version of the Foreign Activities Decree introduces minimum taxation abroad for the first time and confirms the scope of application also for employers with their registered office, management or permanent establishment in an EU/EEA state. In addition, the regulations were adjusted in some places (e.g. with regard to preferential and non-preferential activities, etc.). The waiver of taxation in the wage tax deduction procedure must be applied for by the employer or employee at the tax office of the permanent establishment (so-called exemption certificate).\n\nUntil now, no proof of foreign taxation was required for the exemption of preferential wages. With the new decree, a minimum taxation abroad is now also required, which must be proven by the taxpayer. The minimum taxation is set at 10% and must correspond to the German income tax.",

        "title": "Austria | Parliamentary election results 2024",
        "date": "October 1, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nOn Sunday, September 29 nd 2024, the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) under the leadership of Herbert Kickl secured the first far-right parliamentary election victory, almost three percentage points ahead of the conservative People’s Party (ÖVP). The past five years, Austria has been governed by a coalition government of Chancellor Karl Nehammer’s (ÖVP) and the Green Party, both parties had to suffer significant losses in this election. The coalition negotiations following the election results will be difficult, as the ÖVP currently rules out forming a coalition with the FPÖ under Kickl’s leadership. Implications on immigration policies cannot yet be foreseen as this will depend entirely on which party will be part of the new government.\n\nThe detail\n\nPreliminary results showed the FPÖ taking 29.2% of the vote, followed by the ÖVP with 26.5%, and the Social Democrats (SPÖ) with 21%. The liberal NEOS party won 9% of the vote, with the Green party falling in last place with 8%. To form a majority in the Austrian parliament, 92 (of 183) seats are required. Therefore, the following coalition scenarios seem most likely:\n– a two-party coalition between the FPÖ and the ÖVP;\n– a two-party coalition between the ÖVP and the SPÖ (with only a very slight majority in parliament); or\n– a three-party coalition between the ÖVP, SPÖ and a “junior partner” (either NEOS or the Green party).\n\nWhat will happen next:\n\nThe Austrian constitution grants the Austrian President significant freedom in forming a government, as it does not outline a specific process. Traditionally, assigning the winning political party the task of forming a government is common practice, but it is not explicitly required by the constitution. The president’s main responsibility is to ensure that there is always a functioning government in place and to form one that has majority support in the Parliament. President Van der Bellen has stated that any future government will have to respect the fundamental pillars of Austria’s liberal democracy, such as the rule of law, separation of powers, human and minority rights, independent media, and EU membership. If no agreement on the formation of a coalition government can be reached, the president has the authority to dissolve parliament and call for new elections.\n\nImpact on Immigration:\n\nThe impact on immigration policy will depend on the coalition government formation. In its election program, titled “Fortress Austria,” the FPÖ calls for “remigration of uninvited foreigners,” for achieving a more “homogeneous” nation by tightly controlling borders and suspending the right to asylum via an emergency law. If the FPÖ enters the government, it is likely that there will be stringent measures regarding illegal immigration, however the impact of an FPÖ government on corporate immigration remains unclear. In case of a government between the ÖVP and the SPÖ (possibly with a “junior partner”) a further development and reform of the residence permit for highly qualified individuals and shortage occupations (Red-White-Red Card) is likely to happen, as this had been previously communicated by the current Chancellor Karl Nehammer (ÖVP).\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nValentina Arnez\nAttorney at Law (Arnez Rechtsanwalts GmbH*) & Immigration Expert,\nvalentina.arnez@law.vialto.com\n\nAntonia Lehne\nManager (Arnez Rechtsanwalts GmbH*) & Immigration Expert,\nantonia.lehne@law.vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\n* Please note that Arnez Rechtsanwalts GmbH is cooperating with the Vialto Partners network and is a member to the Vienna Bar Association, registered as an independent legal entity under Commercial register No. FN 596972a.\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Canada | Prorogation of Parliament and the impact on proposed legislation affecting capital gains and stock options",
        "date": "January 10, 2025",
        "content": "Global Mobility Tax\n\n****La version française suit la version anglaise****\n\nSummary\n\nOn January 6th, the Canadian Parliament was prorogued until March 24, 2025. Prorogation results in the cancellation of the draft legislation supporting the changes to the capital gains inclusion rate and stock option deduction discussed in the Vialto Partners Regional Alert published on December 9, 2024. While the CRA confirmed on January 7, 2025 that it will continue to administer the proposed changes for 2024 tax filings, prorogation and the ensuing uncertainty regarding the future of the proposed legislation creates ambiguity for employers and employees regarding tax withholding on stock option income, and reporting of stock options and capital gains on their 2024 tax returns.\n\nThe detail\n\nTo recap, the proposed changes were wide ranging. The following implications are relevant from a global mobility perspective:\n\nWith the prorogation of Parliament, legislation will need to be re-introduced once a new parliamentary session begins on March 24, 2025. Any such legislation may result in a confidence vote for the Liberal government, and if the legislation did not pass at that point, then a general election would be triggered.\n\nSome comments attributed to the Conservative Party suggest that they would not pursue the capital gains and stock option changes if they were to form a majority government. If this were to happen, the previous rules would prevail, creating a mismatch between the withholding and actual tax rates. Employers would need to consider if it was possible to refund a portion of the 2025 withholding tax to the employee, if they had withheld at the higher inclusion rate. It is unclear at this point how an employee would make corrections to tax returns filed with the proposed rates if the legislation is not eventually passed.\n\nThis ambiguity results in a less-than-ideal situation for employees and employers. While the CRA has stated that the proposals will be administered based on the draft legislation, some commentary linked to the Department of Finance has indicated that the CRA will stop administering the changes if Parliament resumes and the government signals it will no longer proceed with the proposed changes to the taxation of capital gains and stock options.\n\nIf an employer withholds at a higher rate based on the proposed rules, there is no exposure to the employer for under-remittance penalties, and any over withheld tax would be refunded on the employee’s tax return. However, over-withholding on employee compensation does have some drawbacks from an employee experience perspective.\n\nIf an employer does continue to withhold at the lower inclusion rate there is still some potential for under-remittance penalties if the legislation does ultimately pass. Equally, if the legislation does pass, there could be some underpayment of tax where the employee has capital gains and option benefits over the $250,000 limit.\n\nRegardless of the withholding rate used by employers on stock option income, we recommend that the new T4 reporting rules are followed as this will align with CRA’s guidance and will also help employees file their 2024 employee tax returns accurately.\n\nThe administration of the proposed changes will be reflected on individual tax returns in accordance with the recent CRA announcement. These forms should be available by January 31, 2025. We would recommend employees complete their returns accordingly until further guidance is provided by CRA, or until there is more certainty regarding the likelihood of the proposed changes being enacted. Please note, according to the CRA Income Tax Audit Manual, proposed amendments have no legal effect until they receive royal assent and, as a result, cannot be imposed on the taxpayer. However, as the amendments are generally applied retroactively after royal assent, the taxpayer is responsible for applying the legislation according to the amended legislation after royal assent. That decision should be made by an individual taxpayer based on a careful analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of that risk based decision.\n\nAs mentioned, the CRA will stop administering the proposed changes if Parliament resumes and the government signals it will no longer proceed with the proposed changes. Hopefully there will be more clarity on this in mid-to-late April 2025, in advance of the April 30th filing deadline.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nChelsea Coosemans\nPartner, Toronto\n\nDan Trinh\nPartner, Vancouver\n\nAlex Legg\nDirector, Calgary\n\nTheo Ciju\nDirector, Toronto\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nFiscalité de la mobilité internationale\n\nRésumé\n\nLe 6 janvier, le Parlement canadien a été prorogé jusqu’au 24 mars 2025. La prorogation entraîne l’annulation du projet de loi soutenant les modifications du taux d’inclusion des gains en capital et de la déduction des options d’achat d’actions discutées dans l’Alerte régionale de Vialto Partners publiée le 9 décembre 2024. Bien que l’ARC ait confirmé le 7 janvier 2025 qu’elle continuera à appliquer les modifications proposées pour les déclarations fiscales de 2024, la prorogation et l’incertitude qui en résultent concernant l’avenir de la législation proposée créent une ambiguïté pour les employeurs et les employés en ce qui concerne la retenue d’impôt sur les revenus des options d’achat d’actions, ainsi que la déclaration des options d’achat d’actions et des gains en capital sur leurs déclarations de revenus de 2024.\n\nDétails\n\nEn résumé, les changements proposés étaient vastes. Les implications suivantes sont pertinentes du point de vue de la mobilité internationale :\n\nAvec la prorogation du Parlement, la législation devra être réintroduite lorsqu’une nouvelle session parlementaire commencera le 24 mars 2025. Toute législation de ce type pourrait engendrer un vote de confiance pour le gouvernement libéral, et si la législation n’était pas adoptée à ce moment-là, cela déclencherait des élections générales.\n\nCertains commentaires attribués au Parti conservateur suggèrent qu’ils ne supporteraient pas les changements concernant les gains en capital et les options d’achat d’actions s’ils devaient former un gouvernement majoritaire. Si cela se produisait, les règles précédentes prévaudraient, créant un décalage entre les taux de retenue et les taux d’imposition réels. Les employeurs devraient envisager s’il est possible de rembourser une partie de l’impôt retenu en 2025 à l’employé, dans le cas où ils auraient retenu à un taux plus élevé. Il n’est pas clair à ce stade-ci comment un employé pourrait corriger les déclarations fiscales déposées avec les taux proposés si la législation n’est finalement pas adoptée.\n\nCette ambiguïté entraîne une situation moins qu’idéale pour les employés et les employeurs. Bien que l’ARC ait déclaré que les propositions seront appliquées en fonction de la législation provisoire, certains commentaires liés au ministère des Finances ont indiqué que l’ARC cessera d’appliquer les changements si le Parlement reprend ses travaux et que le gouvernement signale qu’il ne procédera plus avec les changements proposés concernant la taxation des gains en capital et des options d’achat d’actions.\n\nSi un employeur retient à un taux plus élevé en fonction des règles proposées, il n’y a pas d’exposition au risque pour l’employeur en ce qui concerne les pénalités de sous-retenue, et tout impôt retenu en excès serait remboursé sur la déclaration de revenus de l’employé. Cependant, une retenue excessive sur la rémunération des employés présente certains inconvénients du point de vue de l’expérience des employés.\n\nSi un employeur continue de retenir au taux d’inclusion inférieur, il existe toujours un risque de pénalités pour défaut de retenir si la législation est finalement adoptée. De même, si la législation est adoptée, il pourrait y avoir un sous-paiement d’impôt lorsque l’employé a des gains en capital et des avantages liés aux options dépassant la limite de 250 000 $.\n\nQuel que soit le taux de retenue utilisé par les employeurs sur les revenus des options d’achat d’actions, nous recommandons de suivre les nouvelles règles de déclaration T4, car cela s’alignera aux directives de l’ARC et aidera également les employés à déposer correctement leurs déclarations de revenus pour 2024.\n\nL’administration des changements proposés sera reflétée dans les déclarations de revenus individuelles conformément à la récente annonce de l’ARC. Ces formulaires devraient être disponibles d’ici le 31 janvier 2025. Nous recommandons aux employés de remplir leurs déclarations en conséquence jusqu’à ce que de nouvelles directives soient fournies par l’ARC, ou jusqu’à ce qu’il y ait plus de certitude quant à la probabilité que les changements proposés seront adoptés.\n\nVeuillez noter qu’en vertu du Manuel de vérification de l’impôt sur le revenu de l’ARC, les modifications proposées n’ont aucun effet légal tant qu’elles n’ont pas reçu la sanction royale et, par conséquent, ne peuvent pas être imposées au contribuable. Cependant, comme les modifications sont généralement appliquées rétroactivement après la sanction royale, le contribuable est responsable de l’application de la législation conformément à la législation modifiée après la sanction royale. Cette décision devrait être prise par un contribuable individuel sur la base d’une analyse approfondie des avantages et des inconvénients de cette décision fondée sur le risque.\n\nTel que mentionné, l’ARC cessera d’appliquer les changements proposés si le Parlement reprend ses travaux et que le gouvernement signale qu’il ne procédera plus avec les changements proposés. Nous espérons qu’il y aura plus de clarté à ce sujet d’ici le mi ou fin avril 2025, avant la date limite de dépôt du 30 avril.\n\nContactez-nous\n\nPour une discussion plus approfondie sur ce qui précède, veuillez contacter votre interlocuteur chez Vialto Partners, ou alternativement :\n\nJesse Forand \nAssocié, Montréal\n\nDes informations supplémentaires sur Vialto Partners peuvent être trouvées ici: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (« Vialto ») fait référence aux filiales en propriété exclusive de CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited ainsi qu’aux autres membres du réseau mondial de Vialto Partners.

        "title": "Germany | Immigration | Extended border controls",
        "date": "September 11, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nGermany | Immigration | Extended border controls\n\nSummary\n\nOn September 9, 2024, the German government announced the implementation of temporary border controls at all of its national borders. Starting on September 16, these controls will initially be in place for six months. This decision is a response to the increased pressure from irregular migration and is aimed at limiting unauthorized entries and human smuggling operations. Previously, similar border controls had been in effect at the borders with Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Switzerland, but they have now been expanded to include the borders with France, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark​.\n\nThe Details\n\nInterior Minister Nancy Faeser emphasized that this move is not only about curbing irregular migration but also ensuring domestic security in light of threats such as terrorism and cross- border crime. The controls are intended to be temporary and, according to the German government, comply with European Union law. The government has also developed a legal framework for the rejection of certain individuals at the border, aiming to enhance the effectiveness of these measures​.\n\nSince October 2023, more than 30,000 people have been turned back at Germany’s borders under similar regulations. The expanded controls are intended to further disrupt smuggling networks and reduce the number of unauthorized entries. The government has informed the European Commission about these actions and has announced plans to cooperate closely with neighboring countries, though there have been tensions, particularly with Austria, which has refused to accept individuals rejected by Germany​.\n\nThis move comes in the context of delays in the implementation of a new Common European Asylum System (CEAS), which is intended as a long-term solution for managing migration in the European Union. Until that system is fully operational, Germany has deemed it necessary to strengthen its own border controls​.\n\nImpact on Skilled Immigration\n\nWhile these measures primarily target irregular migration, there may be indirect effects on skilled immigration. Germany, like many other countries, has been actively seeking to attract skilled workers to address labor shortages, especially in sectors such as technology, healthcare, and engineering. However, tighter border controls may complicate the process for legitimate workers and business travelers, particularly if they face delays or additional scrutiny when crossing borders.\n\nThe German government has stated that the controls will aim to minimize disruptions to regular border traffic, including for commuters and business travelers. Nevertheless, any increase in border checks and enforcement actions could lead to longer wait times and more bureaucratic hurdles for those seeking to enter the country legally. Business travellers in particular must be prepared for the increased scrutiny of business activities as a result of border controls.\n\nSkilled workers who rely on cross-border movement or international travel for work could be impacted by these controls, even if they are not the primary targets of the measures​. In the long term, Germany’s ability to balance security measures with its need for skilled labor will be critical to maintaining its position as an attractive destination for international talent.\n\nHow we can help\n\nThe border controls make it necessary for highly qualified foreigners to always have the right and valid residence permits when crossing the border. Travelling without the right documents poses a certain risk.

        "date": "June 5, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nDenmark | Changes to the bank account requirement\n\nSummary\n\nToday, the Danish Parliament adopted a long-awaited amendment in the immigration law regarding the requirement of receiving salary to a Danish bank account. The change means that as of 1 July 2024 employees that have received a Danish residence and work permit under the Fast Track Scheme (short term track, pay limit track, educational track & researcher track) or the Researcher Scheme are no longer required to receive their salary to a Danish bank account.\n\nFor employees that hold a residence and work permit under other work schemes, e.g., the Pay Limit Scheme, the deadline for opening a Danish bank account will be extended from 90 days to 180 days.\n\nThe detail\n\nHow does the change affect you as a Fast Track Certified employer?\n\nThe amendment aims to increase the flexibility for Fast Track Certified companies and companies that hire employees under the Researcher Scheme.\n\nThe amendment means that you as a Fast Track Certified employer will as of 1 July 2024 no longer be obliged to pay salary to a Danish bank account to those of your employees who already hold a residence and work permit under the Fast Track Scheme (short-term track, pay limit track, researcher track & educational track). Going forward, you will not be required to pay salary to a Danish bank account to the employees who in the future will receive a residence and work permit under the short-term track, pay limit track, researcher track & educational track of the Fast Track Scheme.\n\nPlease bear in mind that it is still a requirement that the offered salary level is considered ordinary compared to Danish standards and that the salary is paid in cash (not in benefits), including Danish labour market pension contributions (if applicable).\n\nHow does the change affect you as a non-Fast Track Certified employer?\n\nThe change in law also makes it easier for companies that hire employees under the other work schemes – e.g. the Pay Limit Schemes or the Positive Lists – to stay compliant by extending the time limit to open a Danish bank account from 90 days to 180 days.\n\nThe extension of the deadline is made in acknowledgment of the difficulties that foreign employees can experience when facing the processing times to open a Danish bank account.\n\nAs for Fast Track Certified companies it will still be a requirement that the offered salary level is considered ordinary and is paid in cash (not in benefits) and Danish labour market pension contributions, if applicable, throughout the entire period of employment.\n\nOther changes to the immigration law\n\nFollowing the amendment in the immigration law there has also been an amendment in the job change rule and the Fast Track Scheme’s Short-Term Track, which we will update you on in our next Danish Vialto Newsletter following shortly.\n\nHow we can help\n\nVialto Partners offers specialised Immigration services.

        "title": "Vietnam | Immigration | Labour updates",
        "date": "January 11, 2023",
        "content": "January 2023\n\nImpact High\n\nSummary\n\nResolution No.105/NQ-CP (“Resolution 105”) dated 9 September 2021 on provision of assistance for enterprises, co-operatives, and business households were issued by the Government to support businesses affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, including employers with foreign employees working in Vietnam. As a result, some relaxation on labour procedures were implemented.\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Labour Department has issued the Official Letter No. 374/SLĐTBXH-VLALD dated 9 January 2023 stating that the relaxation on issuance and extension of work permits for foreigners working in Vietnam provided under Resolution 105 is effective till 31 December 2022, which is in accordance with Item 3.8, Article 3, Resolution No.30/2021/QH15 (“Resolution 30”) dated 28 July 2021 issued by the National Assembly.\n\nWith the lapse of Resolution 105, the strict standards set in Decree 152/2020/ND-CP (“Decree 152”) dated 30 December 2020 on work permit issuance are now reinstated.\n\nSee below for full details.\n\nThe Details\n\nThe Government issued Decree 152 providing labour guidance for foreigners working in Vietnam and Vietnamese working for foreign organisations and individuals in Vietnam. Decree 152 came into effect on 15 February 2021, replacing Decree 11/2016/ND-CP (“Decree 11”) dated 3 February 2016.\n\nThough Decree 152 provides clarities on some definitions and procedures on work permit application, at the same time, it also made the process and procedures more extensive and stringent compared to the previous Decree 11.\n\nDue to the disruption of Covid 19 pandemic, the Government introduced Resolution 105 on 9 September 2021 to assist businesses impacted by the COVID-19 lockdown measures. Among others, the Ministry of Labour, Invalids & Social Affairs (“MOLISA”) eased the conditions for issuance and extension of work permits for foreigners working in Vietnam.\n\nFor the convenience of our readers, we highlighted below 4 notable conditions.\n\n1. Under Decree 152 on foreigners working in Vietnam, an expert is defined as an individual having a university degree or equivalent, and with a minimum 3 years working experience relevant to the job position or job assignment that he or she will be appointed in Vietnam. Resolution 105 has loosened this requirement whereby the university degree can be a degree not connected to the job position the foreign expert will be appointed in Vietnam;\n\n2. Under Decree 152, a technical worker means a foreign worker who has been trained in a technical field for at least 1-year, and with a minimum 3 years working experience in his/her training field. Resolution 105 has again softened the requirement whereby the technical training field does not have to relate to the job position the foreign technical workers undertake in Vietnam;\n\n3. Under Decree 152, documents confirming experts and technical workers are (i) diploma, university certificate; and a (ii) written certification from a foreign organisation or company confirming the number of years of experience of the expert, technical worker. Resolution 105 provided a flexible alternative, where a previously issued work permit in Vietnam is accepted as an alternative document, confirming the number of years of experience of the experts or the technical workers;\n\n4. Simplification of document certification process. Under Resolution 105, when applying for a work permit, a certified true copy of passport of the applicant is no longer required.\n\nOther local provincial labour departments are also adhering to Resolution 30 which states that Resolution 105 is effective till 31 December 2022 only.\n\nWith the lapse of Resolution 105, the strict standards set in Decree 152 on work permit issuance have now been reinstated.\n\n\n\nl workers\n\nOther key changes affecting foreigners working in Vietnam include the following:\n\n✓ Foreign teachers working at the inter-level schools are required to prove their expertise according to the requirements regulated in the Law of Education, Decree No.86/2018/NĐ-CP and Official Letter No.1105/HTQT;\n\n✓ Foreign teachers working at foreign language centers are required to prove their expertise as per the requirements regulated in the Law of Education, Decree No.86/2018/NĐ-CP, Circular No.21/2018/BGDĐT and Official Letter No.1105/HTQT.\n\n✓ Under Circular 40/2016/TT-BLĐTBXH dated 25 October 2016 guiding on implementation of a number of Articles of Decree 11/2016/NĐ-CP dated 3 February 2016, there is a clause stating that individuals who hold a valid work permit in one location in Vietnam but work in another province for more than 10 consecutive days are not required to obtain a separate work permit if the work duration is temporary. Such individuals, instead, can file a “work location report” to the provincial labour authorities where he/she works. Resolution 105 provides the same flexibility to those who hold a work permit in one location in Vietnam but need to work in another province for a maximum 6 months. Under the reinstated Decree 152, this clause has been removed.\n\nContact us\n\nPlease reach out to your usual Vialto Partners contact should you have questions on the above.\n\n●  Brittany Chong, Partner, Vietnam: brittany.chong@vialto,com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Belgium | Immigration | Changes to the Flemish immigration policy for employing foreign nationals",
        "date": "May 2, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nBelgium | Changes to the Flemish immigration policy for employing foreign nationals\n\nContext\n\nIn Belgium, the legislative framework concerning the employment of third country nationals is under construction, since the federal state, as well as the different regions, are currently changing their legislation. These changes are mainly caused by the obligation to transpose the revised EU Blue Card Directive (Directive 2021/1883 of 20 October 2021) into Belgian legislation. Access to the labour market is a regional competence in Belgium, due to which the transposition of such EU legislation must be done on a regional level. In addition, the regions have seized this opportunity to also make other changes to their respective labour market policies.\n\nIn light hereof, the Flemish government has published a new decision of 8 March 2024 in the Belgian Gazette on 28 March 2024. This new Flemish decision has entered into force on 1 May 2024. In the Brussels region, the Brussels parliament has accepted a legislative act (i.e. ‘ordonnance’), which has also already been published. A decision from the Brussels regional government is however still required in order to change the actual ‘access to the Brussels labour market policies’, which is only expected by the end of 2024. The Walloon region has also expressed their intention to alter their legislation on economic migration. However, for now, they are yet to publish their proposed ministerial decision.\n\nEffective Changes in the Flemish region\n\nSince the new Flemish decision contains many changes, we are only highlighting the changes that will have the biggest impact on companies, when employing third country nationals in the Flemish region. It is useful for companies to reassess and restructure their immigration strategy as other options may now be more appropriate for employing third-country nationals in Belgium.\n\na) Holders of a single permit can perform a flexi-job without requiring an additional authorisation to work\n\nThe general rule, set forth in article 4 of the old Decision of the Flemish Government of 7 December 2018, stipulates that the authorisation to work for a fixed duration is delivered exclusively for one employer. However, the new Flemish decision will introduce the concept that holders of a single permit issued for a fixed duration, will be allowed to perform ‘flexi-work’ (under certain conditions). Thus, working for an additional employer besides the main working activities for the employer mentioned on the employment approval letter, without requiring an additional authorisation to work.\n\nb) More possible work authorization exemptions for business travelers\n\nThe new Flemish Decision has revised article 16, which contains the exemptions from the work permit requirement. Previously, only two categories of activities were exempted, while in the new Flemish decision a category has been added.\n\nArticle 16(1) now also provides an exemption for persons who &quot;carry out temporary commercial activities related to the employer’s business interests, where no services or goods are supplied&quot;: for example attending conferences, seminars, internal and external business meetings, participating in the negotiation of business contracts, participating in sales or marketing activities and giving or attending training courses. This exemption has a maximum duration of 90 days in a 180-day period.\n\nFor this category of travelers, a Limosa declaration should still be obtained before starting these activities in Belgium.\n\nIt is important to note that these exemptions must be interpreted strictly, which means that any activity which does not fulfill the conditions laid down in article 16 still requires a work authorization.\n\nc) Changes for Medium-skilled and Lower-skilled profiles\n\nArticle 18 has also been amended, which describes the rules for employers to obtain a work authorization for their third country employees who do not fall within the scope of a specific category mentioned in the Flemish decision (for example: EU Blue Card, ICT, highly skilled, specialized technician, etc.). For these employees, a work authorisation is issued to the employer based in Belgium, only when the employer can prove that it is not possible to find an employee suitable for the job on the Belgian labour market within a reasonable period of time. This is the so-called ‘labour market test’.\n\nAs from 1 May 2024, the employer should not only publish the job advert at the VDAB (Belgian platform), but also on the EURES platform in order to reach a broader public (EU platform). Furthermore, based on article 18 §2 this so-called ‘labour market test’ is not required in case the job function is included on a list which is published by the Minister. This list confirms a structural labour market shortage for these functions (the so- called ‘bottleneck professions’). Such a list was already existing, however, it was only updated every two years. The wording has now been altered to ‘at the latest every two years’, implying that this list can be updated whenever this is deemed necessary by the Flemish government. This change should allow for a more dynamic approach, to counter a situation where the list would be outdated due to for example the economic situation and shortages in the Flemish region.\n\nd) European Blue Card holders in the Flemish region\n\nUntil now, employers and employees have been reluctant to apply for a European Blue Card in Belgium,(hereafter EBC), as it offers few advantages compared to the single permit in the highly qualified category. For instance, the EBC can only be used for locally hired employees and there is a higher salary threshold which makes this category less favorable compared to the other available categories. Nevertheless, in light of the transposition of Directive 2021/1883 into national legislation and its implementation in the Flemish decision, there are notable changes, such as:\n\n● The short-term mobility: An EBC holder in a different EU Member State can work in the Flemish region in Belgium for a period of 90 days in 180 days without an additional authorisation to work, in case the working activities in Belgium are based on an employment contract in the EU country and are for the benefit of that legal employer;\n● An applicant for an EBC requires a level 6 VKS qualification degree. This equals a bachelor degree. However, the new Flemish decision now also accepts an equalization of relevant experience to fulfill this requirement in specific limited sectors;\n● Less restriction: Whenever a new employment agreement is concluded between a EBC holder and a new employer within the first 12 months of employment, a notification must be made towards the regional authorities, instead of submitting a new application.\n\nThese changes might have a positive impact on the number of EBCs that will be applied for going forward, since the above changes might make them more attractive to employees. The EBC may also become more attractive for employers wishing to employ third-country nationals who, for example, are already working in Belgium with an EBC. A ‘simple’ notification to the authorities will now be sufficient instead of filing a new permit application in light of changing employers.\n\nConclusion\n\nEven though the transposition of the Blue Card Directive should have already taken place before 18 November 2023, the Flemish region has now transposed it together with some other important changes to their labour market policy.\n\nTherefore, companies employing third country nationals in Belgium should now reassess their immigration strategy to verify whether their current strategy is still in line with the changed legislation.\n\nIn case employers have medium-skilled or lower skilled profiles working in the Flemish region in Belgium on the basis of previously granted single permits, it is worth to already verify whether these can still be extended in the future. Stricter conditions are now applicable to these categories due to which this might no longer be possible.\n\nVialto Partners is continuously following up on the practical implementation of these changes in the Flemish Region and the upcoming changes in the Brussels and Walloon Region.

        "date": "April 14, 2024",
        "content": "The Japanese government officially launched a visa system supporting digital nomads on 31 March 2024. International remote workers and their family members can now apply for a visa status that allows them to stay in Japan for up to six months. Eligible applicants must meet various requirements such as having an annual income of over 10 million yen and being enrolled in private medical insurance.\n\nThe framework of the system is as follows.\n\n\n\n【Family member】\n\n\n\n\n\n【Family member(s)】\n\n1. These are nationals of countries that have tax treaties with Japan AND are from visa-exempted regions.\n2. These are nationals of countries from visa-exempted regions (excluding Panama).\n3. Coverage for medical expenses should be at least 10 million yen per applicant.\n4. Applicant needs to be physically in Japan for the CoE application to be filed. Electronic filing by the applicant is not available.\n5. Some embassies or consulates may not accept direct applications for this visa type without a CoE and applicants should check with the consulate before applying.\n\nIn response to the spread of COVID-19 and the resulting widespread adoption of remote work, there has been an increased demand for a residency status that allows for remote work beyond the current maximum 90 days permitted under short-term stay visas. In addition to addressing this demand, the Japanese government hopes that this will have a spillover effect in boosting domestic consumption by creating an environment where highly skilled remote workers can stay in Japan for longer periods.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that under this framework, the residency status granted under this new system will not classify individuals as medium- to long-term residents within the Basic Resident Register system. Consequently, the remote workers and their families are not allowed to be enrolled in the Japanese social insurance or pension system.\n\nIndividuals interested in taking up this visa should be aware of any exposure to individual tax and social security. Similarly, foreign employers will need to be mindful of the permanent establishment exposure that could be triggered by their employees working in Japan.\n\nOur team can provide comprehensive support on this new visa by assisting you in understanding the program in greater detail, performing eligibility assessments and helping with applications for the visa.

        "title": "Australia | Skills in Demand Visa program commencing 7 December 2024",
        "date": "December 6, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nThe Australian Government has registered the amending regulations to implement the new Skills in Demand (subclass 482) visa program which will commence on 7 December 2024. Key features of the Skills in Demand (subclass 482) visa in comparison to the Temporary Skill Shortage (subclass 482) visa program include a single occupation list for the ‘Core Skills’ stream of the Skills in Demand visa and ‘Direct Entry’ stream of the permanent Employer Nomination Scheme Subclass 186 visa, reduction of qualifying work experience to one-year for all visa applicants and the ability to count time spent working with any sponsoring employer towards the permanent residence requirement for the ‘Temporary Residence Transition’ stream of the Subclass 186 visa.\n\nThe new National Innovation visa is a smaller ‘invitation only’ program for highly talented migrants with an internationally recognised record of exceptional and outstanding achievements in certain priority sectors and who can support productivity growth.\n\nThe detail\n\nAs outlined in our earlier alerts, in December 2023 the Minister for Home Affairs unveiled the final Migration Strategy report which included announcements that a new Skills in Demand visa will replace the current Temporary Skills Shortage (TSS) Visa, as well as a new National Innovation Visa to replace the Global Talent and Business Innovation and Investment visa programs.\n\nThe amending regulations to implement the Skills in Demand Visa (subclass 482) program and National Innovation Visa (subclass 858) visa have now been registered ahead of the commencement on 7 December 2024.\n\nThe Skills in Demand (SID) visa has three streams:\n\nSome other key new features of the SID visa include:\n\nChanges to the ‘Temporary Residence Transition’ stream of the Subclass 186 visa program Complementary changes have also been made to the ‘Temporary Residence Transition’ (TRT) stream of the permanent Subclass 186 visa program to provide clearer access to permanent residence for all temporary skilled workers (Subclass 457, TSS and SID visa holders). Specifically, the amendments:\n\nNational Innovation Visa\n\nThe new National Innovation (subclass 858) Visa (NIV) is intended to target high-calibre migrants with an internationally recognised record of exceptional and outstanding achievements in certain priority sectors. The NIV has the same eligibility criteria as the existing Global Talent (subclass 858) visa, with the key difference that NIV applicants must be invited, in writing, by the Minister to apply for the visa. This aligns the NIV application process with that used in other Skilled Migration visas to facilitate a smaller, more exclusive NIV program than that of the Global Talent visa program.\n\nTransitional arrangements\n\nAll TSS nominations and visa applications lodged prior to 7 December 2024 will continue to be processed under the TSS requirements in force at the time of application and will not be impacted by these regulatory changes. Any approved TSS nominations that were not accompanied by a corresponding TSS visa application can also be linked to a new Skills in Demand visa provided this is done within 12 months of nomination approval. Applicants who have already applied for a Global Talent (subclass 858) visa also will not be impacted and will continue to have their application assessed under the old criteria.\n\nVialto is continuing to closely monitor the release of further details of the Skills in Demand visa and will provide further updates as they become available.\n\nPlease also join us on 11 December 2024 for a webinar covering the latest updates in Australian immigration, including a deep dive into the new Skills in Demand visa program.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nCherie Wright\nPartner & Principal Solicitor\n\nStacey Tsui\nPartner & Principal Solicitor\n\nArathi Tekkam\nDirector\n\nFariha Islam\nDirector\n\nJohn O’Brien\nDirector\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "United Kingdom | Social Security | Modified national insurance—reconciliation for the 2022/23 tax year",
        "date": "November 20, 2023",
        "content": "November 2023\n\nUnited Kingdom | Social Security | Modified national insurance—reconciliation for the 2022/23 tax year\n\nIn brief\nUK National Insurance Contributions (NICs) rates and thresholds are normally only changed annually, with effect from 6 April this year. The 2022/23 UK tax year is therefore very unusual as the rates or thresholds changed three times, as a result of various changes in the UK government and fiscal policy. As a result, annual NIC calculations are more complex for 2022/23 than in prior years.\n\nCompanies which have modified NIC schemes agreed with HMRC file a NIC Settlement Return  (NSR) with HMRC each year, and the above changes will make the 2022/23 NSR more complex.  This is due to the fact that some employees, having a full year liability to NICs require, in effect,  three separate calculations compared to a single one in regular years. This not only results in more administrative tasks to be completed, but also generates additional costs related to an increased scope for the NSR calculations and preparation of the returns.\n\nVialto Partners have decided not to pass on these additional costs to our clients upfront and managed to agree with HMRC that a single, blended rate can instead be used for these calculations, under certain circumstances. This is welcome news for companies who have modified NIC schemes in place, as it means only one calculation per employee could be opted for in relation to the 2022/23 Modified NIC reconciliation, resulting in a more straightforward compliance process and lower associated costs.\n\nIn detail\n\nWhat is the issue? \nThe rates applicable for NICs and the threshold at which employees, employers, and self-employed, start to pay UK social security (National Insurance) – referred to as the Primary\n\nThreshold (“PT”) – have been changed three times since April 2022. Therefore, the 2022/23 tax  year has been an exceptional one from a National Insurance perspective because it has been  effectively split into three different periods for the purposes of calculating contributions, as follows:\n\nIn the UK, HMRC recognise the challenges for employers to report payments delivered overseas  (such as assignment allowances, foreign taxes on behalf of employees under equalisation policies, remuneration delivered via an overseas payroll) on a real-time basis for NIC purposes and offer concessions and a mechanism to reconcile NIC at a later stage via the EP Appendix 7A  and 7B Modified NIC schemes. The Modified NIC scheme is a formal agreement that employers with employees seconded to or from the UK for a limited duration can conclude with HMRC, which allows them to calculate and pay the monthly NICs for these employees on a best estimate basis,  provided the scheme is agreed with HMRC in advance and that the employees are eligible for inclusion in the scheme. The accurate NIC amounts are then reconciled on an annual basis via  an NSR which is filed with HMRC by 31 March following the end of each UK tax year. As noted above, the NSR calculations are complicated for 2022/23 by the multiple changes in rates and thresholds during the year.\n\nWhat is the solution? \nAs a response to the GSS Vialto Partners Team’s proposal, HMRC agreed that a blended rate can be used (when the specific circumstances described below apply), thus simplifying the calculations and bringing the 2022/23 tax year in line with the previous (and future) years in terms of the process to be followed when conducting the Modified NIC reconciliations.\n\nHMRC agreed for a blended rate of NIC to be allowed for those individuals who are liable to NIC for the full 2022/23 UK tax year and are eligible for inclusion on the NSR, in line with Modified NI eligibility rules as included in Appendix 7A. As this therefore only covers UK inbounds, we are liaising with HMRC to see if the agreement can be extended to cover UK outbounds and split year individuals.\n\nWhat next?\nAlthough the blended rate will make the NIC calculations for most employees simpler and is therefore likely to be a good option for many employers, it is important for each company to consider whether to use the blended rate or actual NIC rates for their 2022/23 NSR calculations. Some examples of when using blended rates may not be appropriate include the following:\n\nThe takeaway \nGiven the tax year 2022/23 ended 7 months ago and there are approximately 5 months left to finalise and submit the NSRs for this tax year, HMRC’s agreement to use a blended rate is welcome news as it simplifies the 2022/23 NSRs and so reduces costs. However, it is important to carefully consider on a case-by-case basis whether it is appropriate to use the blended rates.\n\nContact us \nPlease feel free to reach out your local social security contact at Vialto Partners or to the Vialto  Partners Social Security Leadership team:\n\nMartin Muhleder\nGlobal Social Security Partner\nmartin.muhleder@vialto.com\n\nGary Chandler\nUK/Ireland Social Security Director\ngary.chandler@vialto.com\n\nAndrei Ioanei\nGlobal Social Security, Senior Manager\nandrei.x.ioanei@vialto.com\n\nLeanne Birch\nGlobal Social Security, Senior Manager\nleanne.c.birch@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\n© 2023 Vialto Partners.

Starting from December 1, 2023, the Saudi consular post in Islamabad, Pakistan, will also require a Pakistani police clearance report for Saudi work visa applications. These new requirements may cause delays in visa processing and affect start dates for affected applicants and potential employers.\n\nThe Detail\nSaudi consular posts in the United States have introduced a new regulation regarding Saudi work visa applications. As of now, all applicants are required to submit an FBI criminal history report along with the previously required U.S. police clearance report. This requirement applies to applicants of all job titles and has been implemented with immediate effect. Previously, only a U.S. police clearance report was necessary for such applications.\n\nMoreover, there will be a change in the visa application process at the Saudi consular post in Islamabad, Pakistan, starting from December 1, 2023. From that date onwards, applicants for Saudi work visas will also be required to provide a Pakistani police clearance report. It is important to note that currently, only the Saudi consular post in Karachi, Pakistan, necessitates the submission of such police clearance reports.\n\nDue to these additional application requirements, individuals affected by these changes, as well as potential employers, should be prepared for possible delays in the visa processing timeline. These delays may impact the anticipated start dates for employment or other arrangements associated with the visa applications.\n\nHow we can help\nWe are closely monitoring these changes in Saudi Arabia, and can advise you with respect to the impact of those changes as well as conduct any assessments your business might need to comply with the new requirements.\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnir Chatterji\nEMEA Immigration Partner\nanir.chatterji@vialto.com\n\nAli Ibrahim\nDirector, KSA and Bahrain Lead\nali.a.ibrahim@vialto.com\n\nAhmed Amer\nManager\nahmed.amer@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\n© 2023 Vialto Partners.

        "title": "Germany | Employment Tax | Sourcing of trailing income",
        "date": "June 27, 2023",
        "content": "20-June-2023\n\nSummary\n\nIn a decision dated December 21, 2022 (I R 11/20), published in March 2023, the German Federal Tax Court provided an opinion on the application of double tax treaties (DTT) with special emphasis on trailing income. The Court ruled that the decisive perspective for reading an OECD equivalent tax treaty is the residency position of the individual at the time the income is paid. Although the earnings period of the income is still relevant to link the income to the respective employment activities, the residency position during the earnings period is not relevant for determining the allocation of the taxation right.\n\nThe Detail\n\nWhilst the above-mentioned decision of the German Federal Tax Court dealt with the exercise of stock options, the respective principles are in principle applicable on all types of trailing income like bonus payments, mid- or long-term incentives payments, equity remuneration with an underlying earnings period like RSUs and stock options or even jubilee payments.\n\nExample:\n\nAn employee was resident in country A during all of 2022 and received income from employment with an employer of country A throughout the year 2022. The employee worked physically 200 of a total of 240 workdays in country A in 2022 and was on several business travels in various other countries for a total of 40 workdays in 2022. Country A taxed the employee’s 2022 total income because the employee was a resident of country A, had an employer in country A and did not spend any significant time in any other country besides short term business travels.\n\nAs of January 1, 2023, the employee takes up a new employment with a German employer, moves to Germany and becomes a resident of Germany under the rules of the DTT which Germany has with country A. In May 2023 the employee receives a trailing payment from the former employer in country A for the work performed during the calendar year 2022.\n\nBased on the decision of the German Federal Tax Court the application and interpretation of the DTT must be done as per the date the trailing payment is received, i.e. per May 2023. At that point in time the taxpayer is a treaty resident of Germany. Thus, Germany would claim the taxation right for the whole income unless the work which is remunerated by the respective payment has been performed in a country other than Germany and under the respective DTT the taxation right is with this other country.\n\nIn the case at hand the work remunerated was performed in country A (200 workdays during 2022) and in various other countries (40 business travel workdays during 2022). In relation to country A the taxpayer spent more than 183 days in 2022 there and moreover had the employer there, so that under the DTT between Germany and country A the taxation right for the trailing income is allocated to country A insofar as the underlying work was physically performed there. This means that Germany would allocate the taxation right for a ratio of 200/240 of the trailing payment to country A.\n\nFor the remaining portion of 40/240 Germany would however take the point of view that the taxation right is with Germany, given that the underlying workdays were exercised in various other countries and none of these other countries can claim a taxation right under the respective DTTs given the short-term business visitor nature of these stays. In particular, the fact that the taxpayer was a tax resident of country A throughout 2022 is not decisive any longer for income paid in 2023, i.e. after the residency position has changed. Thus, Germany does also not recognize a taxation right of country A for these 40 workdays.\n\nIt needs to be noted that a vice versa result can be given where the residency changed from Germany to another country and trailing income is received after the change of residency and the individual had spent days outside of Germany during the earnings period. However, in those cases special “subject to tax” regulations, proof of actual foreign taxation requirements and German treaty overriding rules may need to be considered, especially where despite change of residency the individual still keeps a German home.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe principles of the decision bring additional complexity to the sourcing of trailing income paid after a change in the residency position. It bears the risk that the other country does not follow the German perspective but considers the residency held during the earnings period to be relevant for determining the taxation right. In this context it needs to be considered that for employment income the DTTs concluded by Germany usually follow an exemption with progression approach and not a foreign tax credit method. Thus, any inconsistencies can usually not be remedied by adjusting foreign tax credits.\n\nA formal reaction of the German tax administration to the court decision has not been issued yet.\n\nHow we can help\n\nVialto teams can support with a thorough evaluation of respective compensation elements, considering the interpretation of the tax treaty by Germany and by the other country.\n\nContact us\n\nPlease reach out to Vialto Germany to discuss further.\n\nMathias Schmitt\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nThis publication has been prepared for general guidance on matters of interest only and does not constitute professional advice.

        "title": "United States | Update on the President’s Executive Order ending birthright citizenship and other recent immigration related actions",
        "date": "January 23, 2025",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nThis alert contains two updates on the Trump Administration’s recent immigration policy changes. First, there has been recent activity in reaction to the birthright citizenship executive order that was signed on January 20, 2025. Since issuing the order, twenty-two states and various organizations have filed lawsuits alleging the Executive Order violates the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution. Second, in an effort to reform the immigration system, President Trump dismissed four senior officials of the Executive Office for Immigration Review.\n\nThe detail\n\nOn January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order titled “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” aiming to end birthright citizenship for children born in the US to undocumented immigrants or those on temporary visas.\n\nThe 14th amendment of the US Constitution states “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” The Executive Order, signed by the President, argues that the 14th amendment does not apply to individuals born in the US to parents who reside in the US undocumented or on a temporary visa. The Order specifies that children born in the US will not automatically acquire citizenship if:\n\nThe provisions are set to apply to individuals born 30 days after the date of the order, which is February 19, 2025.\n\nThe executive order has faced immediate legal opposition from the following:\n\nIf upheld, the Executive Order would affect a significant number of children born in the US to parents who are undocumented or on temporary visas, potentially denying them citizenship and associated rights. The legal battles are expected to proceed through federal courts, with potential appeals to the Supreme Court, which will have significant implications for immigration policy and the interpretation of the 14th Amendment.\n\nOn January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump dismissed four senior officials from the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the agency overseeing the US immigration court system.  Sirce E. Owen has been appointed as the acting director of EOIR. Owen previously served as the chief legal adviser to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during Trump’s first term.\n\nWhat this means\n\nWith respect to the Executive Order that ends birthright citizenship, it is likely the case will ultimately reach the US Supreme Court for a final decision on the constitutionality of the Order.  The courts may also potentially grant an injunction to prevent the Executive Order from going into effect until a final decision is issued.  We will continue to monitor the pending lawsuits and provide updates as they become available.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nManish Daftari\nPartner\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nUnited States | USCIS extends H-1B cap registration until March 25; selections still be to announced by March 31\n\nSummary \nDue to technical issues with the USCIS website, the FY2025 H-1B cap lottery registration period that began at noon on Wednesday, March 6 and was originally scheduled to close at noon on Friday, March 22, has now been extended and will run until 12 pm EST on Monday, March 25, 2024. USCIS still intends to make its H-1B cap lottery selections by March 31.\n\nThe detail\n\nH-1B Cap Registration \nSimilar to last year, because some registrants experienced a temporary system outage when attempting to finalize their registrations, USCIS has extended the registration period until 12 pm Eastern on Monday, March 25, which provides petitioners three additional days to register their prospective beneficiaries. Thus, prior to noon on March 25, all prospective petitioners and legal representatives must have completed the Electronic Registration Process and submitted payment for the registration fee to ensure their prospective beneficiaries are included in this year’s lottery. Despite the extension, USCIS still intends to make its selections by March 31.\n\nH-1B Cap Petitions \nThe H-1B cap petition filing window opens on Monday, April 1, 2024 and runs through Sunday, June 30, 2024. With the newly launched Organization Accounts and the online petition filing system, petitions may be filed online starting on April 1, or they may be mailed to USCIS via postal service or private carrier. USCIS still has not yet provided the new lockbox filing addresses for paper filed forms but should provide this year’s filing addresses on its website by the end of March. USCIS has advised there will be no difference in the adjudication timeline for online versus paper filed petitions.\n\nUSCIS will be hosting a National Engagement on March 28 to address the online petition filing process as well as additional Tech Talks on March 26, April 2, and April 4. The March 28 national engagement requires preregistration to attend, but the links for the Tech Talks may be accessed directly from the USCIS website.\n\nWhat this means \nEmployers and legal representatives have three additional days to register prospective beneficiaries as the registration window has been extended from March 22 until March 25. USCIS still intends to make its selections by March 31. Only those with selected registrations are eligible to file H-1B cap-subject petitions, for which petitioners will also have to adhere to the new fee schedule released by USCIS and effective April 1, 2024, and use the 04/01/24 edition of Form I-129. The 90-day petition filing window runs from April 1 to June 30, 2024.\n\nFor more information concerning the new Form I-129 and the increased filing fees, please refer to our New USCIS fee alert.\n\nContact us \nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nManish Daftari\nPartner\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit: www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nContact us on the following address: me-immigration@vialto.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

The visa requirement will also impact business travel to Ireland for nationals of both countries as pre-clearance will need to be in place before travel can be undertaken.\n\nThe Irish government has however committed to establishing three Visa Application Centres in South Africa along with a dedicated team in Dublin to process applications from South African nationals with a view to processing visa applications quickly and efficiently and we are hopeful that processing times will be minimal.\n\nHow we can support\n\nWe appreciate that this is a significant change to current visa and immigration policy and one that may impact your current employment, immigration and global mobility policies.

        "title": "UK | Autumn Budget 2024",
        "date": "November 4, 2024",
        "content": "Key tax announcements impacting employers and employees\n\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer delivered her Autumn Budget on 30 October 2024, setting out the UK government’s tax and spending plans. Our Autumn Budget summary for UK employers and employees, including global mobility considerations, is outlined below and includes:\n\nThe two significant announcements were the confirmation of the reform of the tax rules for non-UK domiciled individuals and the increase to employer National Insurance, both of which will have implications for UK employers with globally mobile employees. From 6 April 2025 there is both an increase in the employers’ rate of National Insurance to 15%, and a reduction in the\nSecondary Threshold (i.e. the amount of an employee’s earnings at which the employer begins to pay National Insurance) to £5,000, down from £9,100 pa this year.\n\nIncreases to the National Minimum/Living Wage were also announced from April 2025 and, for businesses affected, new rules on carried interest, first for 2025/26 and then a longer-term regime from April 2026.\n\nAs well as changes to income tax and National Insurance, there were also changes announced on inheritance tax, including that an individual will be subject to UK inheritance tax if they have been a UK resident for at least 10 out of the last 20 tax years before a chargeable event, such as death.\n\nA quick recap\n\nPrior to this Autumn Budget, the Labour government had already announced plans to continue to take forward major changes to the UK taxation of foreign income and gains (“FIG”) from 6 April 2025. As a quick recap, the main headlines were:\n\nThe new announcements\n\n\n\nThe rate of employers’ National Insurance (“NIC”) will increase from 13.8% to 15% from 6 April 2025. This will apply to:\n\nIn addition to the above, the Secondary threshold (“ST”) (the point at which employers broadly start paying Class 1 Secondary NIC) will reduce from £9,100 per year to £5,000 from 6 April 2025. For employees earning over the current ST, this will create an additional annual cost of £615 per employee for employers (at the new NIC rate), in addition to the extra costs due to the increase in Class 1 Secondary NIC rates.\n\nTo offset some of the additional cost to employers the Chancellor announced that, from 6 April 2025:\n\nThe Chancellor also announced increases in the Lower Earnings Limit (“LEL”) (to a total of £6,500 per annum) and to Class 2 and 3 NICs, in line with the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) in September 2024 (1.7%). The LEL is the amount an employee must earn within NIC to gain a qualifying year towards the state pension.\n\n\n\nCarried interest is a form of performance-related reward received by fund managers, primarily within the private equity industry. Unlike other such rewards, carried interest can currently be taxed at capital gains tax (“CGT”) rates of 18% and 28% where certain conditions are met.\n\nThe tax treatment of carried interest has been the subject of considerable debate and, following the government’s recent call for evidence, changes to the treatment of carried interest have been announced to appropriately reflect, in the government’s view, the economic characteristics of carried interest and the level of risk assumed by fund managers in receipt of it.\n\nFor 2025/26, carried interest will continue to be taxed within the CGT regime but the tax rate will be increased to 32%. However, from 6 April 2026, carried interest will be taxed fully within the income tax framework, with bespoke rules to reflect its unique characteristics.\n\nUnder the new income tax regime from April 2026, carried interest will be treated as trading profits and subject to income tax and Class 4 NIC, i.e. like self-employed profits. However, reflecting the characteristics of the reward, the amount of ‘qualifying’ carried interest subject to tax will be adjusted by applying a 72.5% multiplier. This will be complex legislation to get right, so the\ngovernment will consult and engage with expert stakeholders on it.\n\nTo the extent that investment management duties are performed outside the UK, it has been possible for non-UK domiciled individuals to exempt from UK tax the portion of carried interest relating to such overseas duties. This will still be possible; however, the relief will only be available for the first four years, in line with the new FIG regime.\n\nThe government also plans to remove the ERS exclusion to ensure the Income-based carried interest (“IBCI”) rules apply fairly to all fund managers regardless of their employment status.\n\nThe government currently has no plans to change the tax treatment of co-investment.\n\n\n\nThe government confirmed that payrolling benefits in kind will become mandatory, in phases, from April 2026. Whilst much of the technical detail is to be considered, key points are that:\n\nFurther technical detail and draft legislation are expected in 2025 and we look forward to liaising with HMRC to discuss and understand how these measures will apply to more complex scenarios, including globally mobile workers. In addition to the above, the government confirmed that previous commitments made that the official rate of interest (“ORI”) used to calculate the taxable value of employment related loans and living accommodation would not be increased during a tax year will no longer be applicable. As of 6 April 2025 the ORI may increase, decrease, or be maintained throughout the year. The rate will continue to be reviewed on a quarterly basis and any changes in the rate will occur following a quarterly review, where appropriate. This is likely to add even more complexity to payrolling these items, which might deter many employers from voluntarily registering to payroll these.\n\n\n\nThe National Living Wage (“NLW”) will increase from 1 April 2025 from £11.44 an hour to £12.21 an hour (an increase of 6.7%).\n\nWith effect from 1 April 2025, National Minimum Wage (“NMW”) rates have been increased as follows:\n\n\n\nThe nil-rate Inheritance tax (“IHT”) bands are to be fixed at current levels until 5 April 2030. The nil-rate band will therefore continue to be £325,000 and the residence nil-rate band of £175,000 is retained (tapered after £2 million).\n\nThe Chancellor has however announced reforms that include inherited and unused pensions becoming subject to inheritance tax, with additional reforms affecting Agricultural Property Relief (“APR”), Business Property Relief (“BPR”), and AIM-listed shares.\n\nThe government will also bring unused pension funds and death benefits payable from a pension into a person’s death estate, to\nbe subject to inheritance tax, from 6 April 2027.\n\nUnder the new rules, the first £1 million of combined business and agricultural assets will remain exempt from inheritance tax. Assets exceeding this threshold will incur inheritance tax with a 50% relief, resulting in an effective 20% tax rate on APR and BPR assets above £1 million.\n\nSignificant changes to IHT rules for non-domiciled individuals will take effect from 6 April 2025. These changes are being introduced sooner than anticipated under the previous government’s timeline.\n\nAs of 6 April 2025, the concept of domicile will no longer apply to determine IHT liability. Instead, an individual will be subject to UK IHT if they have been a UK resident for at least 10 out of the last 20 tax years before a chargeable event, such as death.\n\nCurrently, offshore trusts holding non-UK assets are exempt from IHT if the settlor was non-domiciled at the time the trust was established. However, this protected status will end under the new rules. For trusts settled by a long-term UK resident non-domiciled settler, any previously excluded property will become relevant property on 6 April 2025. Exit charges will apply after this date or on each ten-year anniversary of the trust, effectively bringing settlor-interest trust assets within the scope of IHT alongside directly owned assets if the settlor meets the long-term residence requirement.\n\nTransitional rules will apply to non-domiciled individuals who are non-resident in the 2025/26 tax year. For individuals who break UK residence, the period (or “Tail”) they remain within the scope of UK IHT will depend on their residence history over the past 20 years. Those with 10 to 13 years of UK residency will remain in scope for three years, with an additional year added for each year of\nresidence beyond that. Once an individual has been non-resident for 10 consecutive years, they will be outside the scope of UK IHT on non-UK assets.\n\nOther announcements\n\n\n\nWhat we did not see\n\nAs well as the announcements made in the Autumn Budget, there were other possible announcements that were noticeable by their absence. Some of the possible tax changes that had been discussed before the day, but which were not mentioned include:\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively one of our technical experts:\n\nAsh Majithia\nPartner\n\nSarah Hewson\nEmployment Tax\n\nJenny Adams\nGlobal Mobility\n\nGemma Ludwig\nGlobal Equity and Reward\n\nTim Sexton\nPensions\n\nIan Robinson\nImmigration\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Hong Kong | Global Mobility Policy | 2023 policy address: Continued focus on talent attraction",
        "date": "October 26, 2023",
        "content": "Summary\nMr. John Lee Ka-Chiu, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong SAR Government, delivered his second policy address today. Following the implementation of the initiatives from Mr. Lee’s first policy address and coming out of the pandemic, the Government will continue to create strong impetus for growth. Among other policy measures, the focus on retention and attraction of overseas talent and enterprise is clear. The Government will develop “headquarters economy” to attract enterprises from outside Hong Kong to set up headquarters and/or corporate divisions in Hong Kong. Facilitation mechanism will also be introduced to attract companies domiciled overseas, in particular those with a business focus in the Asia-Pacific region, for re-domiciliation to Hong Kong.\n\nNew Immigration Measures\nTo accommodate the above initiatives to trawl for enterprises and talents, new immigration measures have been announced as follows:\n\nUpdate on Employment Tax\nThe Government has announced plans to review current legislation relating to statutory minimum wage and contractual arrangements as follows:\n\nPromoting Fertility and Creating a Pro-childbearing Environment \nThe Government recognizes the significant issue of low birth rates and is taking measures to address it. In this policy address, several monetary and tax-related initiatives are introduced to encourage childbirth:\n\nIt is important to note that further details regarding the eligibility criteria and specific tax implications of these measures will be announced by the Government. Taxpayers should stay informed about the official guidelines and updates to ensure compliance and optimize their tax deductions.\n\nOur Observations \nThe Government’s determination in attracting and retaining talents is crystal clear. While the above policy measures offer additional pools of talents, employers are advised to keep abreast of the latest immigration rules and ensure that the talents have the proper immigration status to commence employment. In planning foreign talents to come to Hong Kong for work, it is important to consider relevant implications (e.g. individual income tax, immigration, etc.) holistically from both the employer’s and employee’s perspectives. In addition, notwithstanding the facilitation measures for foreigners to travel to the Mainland by way of the “multiple-entry visa,” the purpose of their trips as well as the number of days of presence in the Mainland should be monitored in order to assess relevant risks and ensure regulatory compliance.\n\nWhilst the Government has temporarily enhanced the mechanism for admitting talent and labor, there is a continuous focus on prioritizing local workers for employment opportunities. In this policy address, measures are proposed to improve basic employment conditions. Employers should closely monitor the changes to the statutory minimum wage mechanism and the “418” requirement as it will directly impact employment costs and business operation.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nJames Clemence\nAsia Pacific CEO\njames.clemence@vialto.hk\n\nTheresa Chan\nPartner\ntheresa.chan@vialto.hk\n\nAdam Chiu\nPartner\nadam.chiu@vialto.hk\n\nLouis Lam\nPartner\nlouis.lam@vialto.hk\n\nBruce Lee\nPartner\nbruce.lee@vialto.hk\n\nSteven Lim\nPartner\nsteven.lim@vialto.hk\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com",

        "content": "Immigration\n\nSaudi Arabia | Immigration | Academic verification platform launched\n\nAcademic Verification Platform Launched\n\nSummary \nSaudi Arabia has launched the Qualification Verification Program (QVP), an online platform aimed at verifying the academic qualifications of foreign nationals applying for work visas.\n\nThe Detail \nSaudi Arabia has introduced the Qualification Verification Program (QVP), an immediate-use online platform designed to validate the academic qualifications of foreign nationals applying for work visas. The program ensures that applicants possess the necessary educational qualifications for their intended occupation before entering the country.\n\nCurrently, the QVP platform is mandatory for work visa applicants from 62 countries that do not have a Saudi Cultural Attaché. It also applies to individuals working in industries such as agriculture, aviation, commerce, construction, education, health, and more.\n\nThe list of countries without a Saudi Cultural Attaché has not been publicly disclosed by Saudi authorities. Foreign nationals are encouraged to contact their relevant Saudi consular post for detailed information regarding the utilisation of the QVP.\n\nThe implementation of the QVP represents a significant step in the work visa application process, aiming to streamline the verification procedure. However, the exact impact of the new system on processing times remains uncertain.\n\nThe QVP is expected to gradually expand its coverage to encompass foreign nationals from all countries and industries applying for work visas. It is part of Saudi Arabia’s broader Professional Accreditation program, which seeks to regulate the labor market.\n\nIt is important to note that despite the introduction of the QVP, all foreign nationals must still legalise their academic qualifications before submitting them as part of their work visa application. This requirement applies to applicants regardless of whether they qualify for the use of the QVP at present.\n\nHow we can help \nWe are closely monitoring these changes in Saudi Arabia, and can advise you with respect to the impact of those changes as well as conduct any assessments your business might need to comply with the new requirements.\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nContact us \nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnir Chatterji\nEMEA Immigration Partner\n\nAli Ibrahim\nDirector KSA and Bahrain Lead\n\nAhmed Amer\nManager\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "EU | Employment Tax | Agreement on the proposed European Commission’s Platform Worker Directive – will this change the employment tax and immigration landscape of the industry?",
        "date": "July 12, 2023",
        "content": "3 July 2023\n\nLast month, EU ministers agreed on the Council’s general approach for a proposed Directive aimed at improving working rights for platform workers within the EU. One of the primary impacts of this would be to introduce a legal presumption that self-employed workers in this sector are employed.\n\nWith millions of workers in the EU currently falling within this category, organisations need to act fast in order to understand if and how this applies to their workforce.\n\nThis article outlines what this could mean from an employment tax, social security and immigration perspective for those impacted – and importantly, what organisations can be doing now to prepare.\n\nThe background\n\nIn recent years digital labour platforms have grown rapidly – driven by consumer trends towards quick and on demand services, as well as workers opting for more flexible working arrangements, or taking advantage of ways to earn additional income. Covid-19 accelerated these trends – resulting in more than 28 million individuals in the EU currently working on digital labour platforms, with predictions that this will grow to 43 million by 2025.\n\nWhilst the majority of platform workers are genuinely self-employed, there are estimates from the European Council that approximately 5.5 million workers could in fact misclassified, when based on the substance of the relationship, they should be considered as employed – with the associated benefits employment grants (such as the right to a minimum wage, paid leave and social protection). There are also concerns about the fairness and accountability of algorithm management within the industry for matters such as equal pay between men and women and discrimination.\n\nIncreasingly, national authorities are facing difficulties in trying to enforce the protection of workers rights in the sector – due in large to the cross-border and often opaque nature of digital labour platforms, meaning authorities often do not have access to data on where work is being performed and/or by whom.\n\nIn light of this backdrop, the Platform Worker Directive amendments, voted in favour by the EU parliament earlier this year, aim to ensure:\n\ni)  that platform workers can have the opportunity to hold their correct employment status;\n\nii) fairness and accountability in algorithmic management, and;\n\niii) greater awareness, transparency and traceability of platform work.\n\nThese changes build upon specific obligations relating to platform workers under the Transparent & Predictable Working Conditions Directive. They are also in line with the broader direction of travel we have seen globally over recent years – across all industries – where organisations face increasing obligations to ensure compliance of their total workforce – inclusive of their contingent labour. This Directive further adds to that pressure – and reiterates the importance for organisations to have visibility of their whole labour supply chain.\n\nWhat are digital platforms?\n\nDigital labour platforms provide a commercial service, which uses automated systems (or algorithmic management) to match the supply of work and the demand for work, typically via an online platform, such as a website or app.\n\nWell known examples of these are ride-share, delivery and domestic services, which use the platform to provide physical services. However, other sectors such as data-coding and design may operate solely online.\n\nA platform worker is an individual who uses such platforms to access individuals or organisations in order to provide services in exchange for payment. The Directive will apply to individuals performing platform work within the EU, irrespective of where the platform is hosted.\n\nWhat does this mean for digital platforms?\n\nA central component of the draft Directive is that appropriate procedures for determining employment status must be in place and that all platform workers have the right to claim the (rebuttable) presumption of an employment relationship. These measures are intended to counteract the incorrect classification of employment status.\n\nThe  presumption of employment status will apply, if the current proposal is approved, where the platform exerts control and direction over the performance of work. This is assessed where three out of seven criteria are met, including factors such as the platform: establishing levels of remuneration; implementing rules regarding conduct and appearance; controlling working hours and periods of absence, and/or; restricting the worker from building their own client base or working for clients; amongst other specifics.\n\nThis presumption will be taken into consideration for administrative or judicial proceedings to determine the employment status of the person, but based on the current wording, will not automatically apply to tax, criminal and social security proceedings.\n\nHowever, as individual countries look to implement the Directive, they may include additional tax and social security requirements into their own national law – which could have significant knock-on implications from an employment tax, social security and immigration perspective. For example:\n\nSuch implications are likely to have a substantial impact on digital platforms with workers operating in the EU over the short to medium term.\n\nWhat do digital platforms need to do?\n\nWe expect the European Council to approve the Directive early in 2024. Following which, member states will have two years to implement the Directive into their national law. Given the potential scale, tiers and geographical spread of labour supply chains, this doesn’t provide much time for organisations to prepare for the implications effectively.\n\nIn the first instance, platforms should work through a review to understand the potential impact this creates – for example:\n\nPlatforms can than work to implement an efficient and compliant operating model, which may include:\n\nVialto Partners\n\nIn the build up to the implementation of the Directive, our global team is working with organisations to deliver technology enabled solutions to assess tax impacts in the short term, implement effective governance models in the medium term, and outsource downstream employment tax and immigration obligations for the future.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on how we can help, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nConor Tobin, Director – Contingent Workforce Lead: c.l.tobin@vialto.com\n\nAsh Majithia, Partner – Global Employment Tax Leader: ashish.majithia@vialto.com\n\nClaire Pepper, Partner – EMEA Immigration Leader: claire.pepper@vialto.com\n\nMathias Schmitt, Partner – EMEA Employment Tax Leader: mathias.schmitt@vialto.com\n\nVialto Partners have contingent worker tax specialists in more than 45 locations – who work with organisations to effectively manage total workforce strategy and compliance.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com Vialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Hong Kong | Immigration | New capital investment entrant scheme",
        "date": "December 22, 2023",
        "content": "20 December 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nHong Kong | New capital investment entrant scheme\n\nImpact: Medium\n\nSummary\n\nIn response to the Policy Address announced by Mr. John Lee Ka Chiu, the Chief Executive of HKSAR in October 2023 as well as “The Policy Statement on Developing Family Office Businesses in Hong Kong” issued by the Finance Services and the Treasury Bureau in March 2023, the HKSAR Government announced the details of the new Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (“CIES”) in Hong Kong on 20 December 2023. The new CIES aims at attracting high net worth investors and entrepreneurs from the world to enrich the talent pool and to contribute to economic growth and long-term development in Hong Kong. The HKSAR Government has enhanced the investment requirements for the new CIES scheme which will require each eligible applicant to invest a minimum of HK$30 million to permissible financial assets, non- residential real estate and the new CIES investment portfolio managed by the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited (“HKIC”). The new CIES will be officially launched and applications will be accepted from the middle of 2024. Further details of the new scheme as well as the application procedures will be provided by the relevant government bodies later.\n\nThe Detail\n\nEligibility\n\nAn individual who meets the following general eligibility criteria may apply for the new CIES which is due to launch in mid-2024:\n\n• Aged 18 or above;\n• Foreign national (except for those otherwise excluded), Chinese national who has obtained permanent resident status in a foreign country, Macao Special Administrative Regional Resident, or Chinse resident of Taiwan;\n• Net assets of not less than HK$30 million to which the applicant is absolutely beneficially entitled throughout the two years immediately before submission of the application.\n\nMinimum Investment Requirements\n\nApplicants must make an investment of a minimum of HK$30 million of which HK$27 million has to be invested in permissible financial assets, such as equities, debt securities, certificates of deposits, subordinated debt and other eligible collective investment schemes, and non- residential real estate. Details of the permissible investment portfolio are available here:\n\nhttps://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202312/19/P2023121900385_442644_1_1702988180672.pdf\n\nThe remaining HK$3 million has to be placed into a new CIES Investment Portfolio which will be set up and managed by the HKIC to make investments in companies or projects with a Hong Kong nexus.\n\nEntry of Dependents\n\nApplicants of CIES may apply to bring their accompanying dependants such as legally married spouse and unmarried dependent child aged under 18 years to Hong Kong as dependants for residence.\n\nDuration of Visa and Extension of Stay\n\nUpon review, the Hong Kong Immigration Department will grant “Approval in Principle” to eligible applicants who can then travel to Hong Kong as visitors for a period of not more than 180 days in order to make the required level of investment in the permissible financial assets. Upon formal approval, successful applicants will be granted initial visas with permission of stay up to two years.\n\nFor extension, applicants will need to comply with the relevant portfolio maintenance requirements and rules on any switches of investment. Extension of stay will generally be granted in accordance with a 3-3-year pattern for successful applications.\n\nHong Kong Permanent Resident (HKPR)\n\nUpon a period of continuous ordinary residence in Hong Kong for not less than seven years, applicants may apply to become HKPRs. If an applicant is unable to fulfil the continuous ordinary residence requirement, while continuously satisfying the financial requirement under the new CIES for not less than seven years, he/she may apply for unconditional stay in Hong Kong which allows him/her to reside in Hong Kong without any limitation.\n\nApplicants are free to dispose the invested asset portfolio upon approval of the HKPR / unconditional stay application.\n\nObservations and Recommended Actions\n\nThe introduction of the new CIES is welcome news to the Hong Kong economy and talent market. The new CIES is expected to bring in additional investment funds of HK$120 billion to Hong Kong and will attract entrepreneurs and high net worth investors from around the world to choose Hong Kong as their business destination as well as place of residence. Implementation of the new CIES will strengthen Hong Kong as a hub of asset and wealth management and bring in more business opportunities for various market stakeholders.\n\nWith the additional requirements of placing HK$3 million into a new CIES investment portfolio, the scheme not only provides an opportunity for high net worth investors to directly invest in the permissible investment portfolio in the existing financial market, but also supports the development of innovation, technology and other strategic industries in Hong Kong which can contribute to the development of new industries, fostering innovation and enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness in the global market in the long run.\n\nFrom an immigration compliance perspective, upon approval of a CIES visa application, eligible investors as well as their dependants are permitted to reside, work, establish business and study in Hong Kong within the validity of their CIES visas. As such, employers should update their internal policies to include this type of residence visa for right-to-work check purpose in order to timely and properly onboard candidates who hold the CIES visas in Hong Kong.\n\nIndividuals who are interested to apply for a visa under the CIES are also advised to consider other relevant implications and plan ahead properly. For example, there may be tax implications in respect of the transfer of assets from their current residing (or other) locations to Hong Kong and the establishment of residency in Hong Kong. Failure to consider holistically may result in non compliance, penalties, or other adverse consequences.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nJames Clemence\nChief Executive Officer, APAC\njames.clemence@vialto.hk\n\nAdam Chiu\nPartner\nadam.chiu@vialto.hk\n\nLouis Lam\nPartner\nlouis.lam@vialto.hk\n\nBruce Lee\nPartner\nbruce.lee@vialto.hk\n\nSteven Lim\nPartner\nsteven.lim@vialto.hk\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "date": "March 7, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nMiddle East | Government processing delays during Ramadan and Eid\n\nSummary \nThe Islamic holy month of Ramadan is expected to start on 10 March and end on 9 April 2024. Governments around the Middle East have announced that during this month, Government offices as well as the private sector will observe shorter working hours.\n\nThe Detail \nImmigration processing delays are expected throughout the next few weeks during the month of Ramadan, and may continue in the weeks following the Eid period, marking the end of Ramadan. Companies and Government offices will adopt reduced working hours across the Middle East. The Private sector in the UAE will reduce their working hours by two hours as per the Labour Law, and this applies to non-fasting employees as well (except in the DIFC and ADGM, where reducing hours for non-fasting employees is a business decision). The official working hours for federal government employees in the UAE during Ramadan will be from 9am to 2.30pm, from Monday to Thursday, and from 9am to 12pm, on Fridays, each week. In the KSA and Qatar, the private sector will also reduce their working hours by two hours as per the Labour Law, and this applies to employees across all jurisdictions – it has yet to be announced by the Governments of the KSA and Qatar what the official working hours will be.\n\nWhat this means \nIn the UAE, employers and employees should anticipate processing delays during this period. Government offices as well as the private sector will close for three to four days during Eid Al Fitr, immediately following the month of Ramadan. In Qatar, the private sector will be closed for three official days, and Government offices will be closed for at least seven days (sometimes up to 10 days), depending on the Government’s official announcement. In KSA, employees are given four working days as official holidays – if these days fall on the weekend, additional days are granted by the Government. In case of time sensitive applications, companies should plan ahead and consider applications may take longer to process due to reduced Government working hours.\n\nHow we can help \nWe will continue to closely monitor and provide timely guidance on any new updates by the Immigration authorities in the Middle East concerning the upcoming public Eid holiday. We will also assist with strategising the timing of submission of visa and residence permit applications, and anticipated approval timelines in light of possible delays from the standard Government processing times.\n\nContact us \nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnir Chatterji\nEMEA Immigration Partner\n\nAli Ibrahim\nDirector, KSA & Bahrain Immigration Lead\n\nRekha Simpson \nDirector, Middle East Immigration\n\nRens Jongerius \nManager, UAE Immigration\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nContact us on the following address – me-immigration@vialto.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

The pay limit amount is subject to regulation every year.\n\nThe pay limit has been regulated this year and the new increased pay limit will apply to applications submitted from 1 January 2025 under the Pay Limit Schemes and the Fast track Scheme’s Pay Limit tracks.\n\nThe new pay limit for applications submitted under the Pay Limit Schemes is DKK 514,000 per year.\n\nWhile the new pay limit for applications submitted under the Supplementary Pay Limit Scheme, and the Fast Track Scheme’s Supplementary Pay Limit track is DKK 415,000 per year.\n\nSIRI uses the salary statistics of the Danish Employers’ Association (DA) in their case processing to assess whether an offered salary is ordinary in accordance with Danish standards.\n\nThe salary statistics get updated every quarter. SIRI will be using the newest salary statistics with information from the third quarter of 2024 for all applications submitted from 1 January 2025.\n\nThe salary statistics can be found here.\n\nForeigners must pay a governmental fee in connection to applications that are submitted within SIRI’s case area. In general the governmental fee is regulated every year as the governmental fee must reflect the actual costs associated with the case processing.\n\nThe governmental fees for applications for residence permits submitted within SIRI’s case area has decreased in 2025 compared to 2024.\n\nPlease see the table below.\n\nAn amendment to the Danish Aliens Act means that SIRI as per 1 January 2025 can request people who are assessed to be working for a company during an inspection to show their identification.\n\nThe new amendment means that SIRI will have a better opportunity to check whether a foreign employee holds a valid residence and work permit, and whether the conditions for the residence and work permit have been complied with.\n\nSIRI has updated the Positive Lists.

        "date": "July 18, 2023",
        "content": "17 July 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nThe Chief Secretary to Treasury, John Glen MP, announced that fees for most visas and settlement applications, and other services, will see increases to help fund the pay rise for Police Officers and Doctors in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Detail\n\nGlen announced that work visas, which could include all visas in the work category of the Points Based System, along with other visas such as Ancestry and Government Authorised Exchange, could see increases of 15% in fees. Visit visas will also be increased by 15%. The Government is yet to announce when these changes will come into effect.\n\nOther immigration categories will see an even higher increase of ‘at least’ 20%, meaning that at the point the Home Office introduces the new fees, it may be higher than the proposed base rate of 20%. These categories will include study visas and entry clearance applications as well as settlement (Indefinite Leave to Remain/Enter) and citizenship applications. Glen also announced that Certificate of Sponsorships, currently GBP 199 per application, will increase by 20% and services to expedite applications, such as the Priority Service, will also be increased by the same amount.\n\nThe Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) will see the largest increase – the Treasury announced that under the Government’s plans ‘the main rate will increase to GBP 1,035 [from GBP 624], and the discounted rate for students and under-18s will increase to GBP 776. That increase to the surcharge will help to fund the pay rise for doctors.’ IHS payments are submitted with the visa application form and those applying for visas from outside of the UK that are 6 months or less are not required to pay it.\n\nWe have provided a provisional table of what some current fees of main immigration categories look like, and what they may look like once the changes come in.\n\n* Unlike other costs, the Certificate of Sponsorship and Immigration Skills Charge must be paid by an employer.\n\nScenario 1:\n\nAn employer looking to sponsor an applicant in the United Kingdom for 3 years on a skilled worker visa is currently incurring GBP 5,790 in Home Office fees. Under the proposed new fees, employers and employees will be subject to the following costs:\n\nCertificate of Sponsorship (CoS): GBP 239, Immigration Skills Charge: GBP 3,000, Visa Application: GBP 827, Immigration Health Surcharge: GBP 3,105. The total fees will be GBP 7,171\n\nScenario 2:\n\nAn applicant with a spouse/partner and 2 children below the age of 18, will be subject to the following fees: Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS):\n\nGBP 239, Immigration Skills Charge: GBP 3,000, Visa Application: GBP 3,308 Immigration Health Surcharge: GBP 12,420. The total fees will be GBP 18,967\n\nRecommended Action\n\nThe implications and necessary actions will differ depending on the size of your population and cost sensitivities.  Actions are likely to include, but unlikely to be limited to, the following:\n\nYour message to the business could read:\n\nHow we can help\n\nPlease reach out to your Vialto Partners contact, or our team below, to discuss further these proposed changes.

This is following a change in legislation by the Romanian government.\n\nThe detail\n\nFrom 17 May 2024, the adoption of Government Ordinance 505/2024 brings some changes to the Government Ordinance 367/2022 regarding the establishment of conditions for ensuring temporary protection status in Romania.

In addition to the previous format, the residence permit for the beneficiaries of temporary protection status in Romania will now include the full residential address.\n\nIn order to attest the residential address in Romania, the applicants for temporary protection status will need to submit supporting documents to the competent territorial Inspectorate for Immigration, when requesting the issuance of the residence permit.

        "date": "April 10, 2025",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nThe Saudi Arabian government has temporarily suspended the issuance of new short-term visas for citizens of 14 countries as part of efforts to regulate travel ahead of the upcoming Hajj season. Nationals from these countries who already hold valid visit visas are advised to check with their local Saudi embassy before travelling to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe detail\n\nStarting April 2025, citizens from the following countries will be unable to apply for short-term visas, including single and multiple-entry business visas, e-tourist visas, or family visit visas:\n\nIn addition, nationals from these countries who hold valid visit visas and need to enter Saudi Arabia from April and until the 15 of June are advised to check permissibility of travel with their local Saudi embassy before travelling.\n\nIf the nationals from the countries listed above are already in Saudi Arabia it’s also advised that they register an Absher account when in the Kingdom to verify the expiry dates of their visas and permissible stay in the Kingdom on the link here.\n\nAs always, business travellers on a visit visa are only allowed to conduct permissible business activities during any trips to the KSA.\n\nThis decision has been made to address logistical challenges and overcrowding from the previous Hajj season and was made in order to improve coordination of arrivals, optimise visa management and guarantee a safe Hajj.\n\nRegular travel into Saudi Arabia and visa issuance for nationals from the list above is expected to resume from 15 June 2025, although this has not been confirmed officially.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThese changes will affect select foreign employees who are travelling to Saudi Arabia for business, leisure and family visits purposes. Companies should review their current population, assess if there are any employees impacted by this change and look at alternative options to enable their travellers to travel to Saudi Arabia, as an attempt to minimise disruption.\n\nDepending on the situation, the new regulations may require employers to adjust travel itineraries to ensure compliance.\n\nHow we can help\n\nAt Vialto Partners we possess the necessary expertise to help you navigate the ever-changing Immigration landscape within Saudi Arabia and we can support you with understanding how these changes could impact your business. We can advise you as to the visitor and business visa requirements, conduct assessments and ensure overall Immigration compliance.\n\nWe will continue to closely monitor and provide timely guidance on updates and changes announced by the Saudi Arabian Government.\n\nFor tailored advice on how these changes may affect your business or employees, please contact our team.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnir Chatterji\nEMEA Immigration Partner\n\nAli Ibrahim\nDirector, Middle East Immigration\n\nAhmed Amer\nManager, Middle East Immigration\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "date": "February 2, 2023",
        "content": "31 January 2023\n\nSummary\n\nThe law of 23 December 2022, amending the Labour Code and transposing Directive (EU) 2020/1057 into national law, brings new developments in the context of the posting of employees. The law entered into force on 27 December 2022.\n\nThe Details\n\nThe law modifies certain general provisions of the Labour Code regarding the secondment of employees.\n\nThe list of information and documents requested by the Labour and Mines Inspectorate has been reduced.\n\nSince 23 December 2022, it is no longer mandatory to upload the following documents on the authorities’ portal to complete the posted worker declaration – “badge social” (PWD):\n\nThe authority’s website (https://edetach.itm.lu/edetach/) has been updated and these documents are no longer marked mandatory in the system.\n\nThe law also limits the joint and several liability provided for in Article L. 281-1 of the Labour Code solely to situations of subcontracting chains and defines new specific rules for the road transport sector.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThese changes make the declaration process more efficient by easing some requirements and facilitating the declaration process for employers willing to temporarily send employees to Luxembourg.\n\nThe list of documents to upload on the system to complete the notification has been reduced to the following:\n\nThe company must keep all these documents for the duration of the secondment at the place of work of the employee posted in Luxembourg or in any place accessible to the reference person so that it can be shared with the Labour and Mines Inspectorate in case of inspection (Art. L.142-3 of the Labour Code).\n\nContrary to the Belgian (Flemish) rules, where legislation is upcoming to increase the burden for companies ‘receiving’ foreign workers at their premises, legislation in Luxembourg becomes more business friendly by reducing the number of required / obligatory documents.\n\nHow can we help\n\nPlease do reach out to your Vialto Partners contact should you have any questions on the above. Our team can help you with:\n\n– Re-assessing the individual situation at the light of this new legal framework.\n– Posted worker notification compliance and assistance with posting declaration and documents upload on the authority’s portal.\n\nContact us\n\n• Maud Aupetit, Senior Immigration Manager (maud.loriquet.aupetit@vialto.com).\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here.\n\nThis publication has been prepared for general guidance on matters of interest only and does not constitute professional advice.

        "title": "Luxembourg | Employment Tax | New tax reliefs announcement",
        "date": "July 22, 2024",
        "content": "Employment tax\n\nLuxembourg | New tax reliefs announcement\n\nSummary\n\nOn 17 July 2024, Luxembourg Minister of Finance Gilles Roth presented to the Parliamentary Finance Committee the government’s “Entlaaschtunggs-Pak”, a tax relief package including new measures to reduce Luxembourg taxpayers’ income tax burden and to increase the attractivity of the country for foreign investors. These measures are already included in Bill 8414 which was filed to the Luxembourg Parliament.\n\nThe detail\n\nLower income tax rates for Luxembourg individuals\n\nRevised income tax brackets\n\nLuxembourg income tax brackets as from 2025 are announced to be extended. Therefore, the progressivity of income tax will be reduced. For 2024, 4 indexations were already introduced into the tax scales and 2.5 additional ones will be included for 2025 tax year. This will lead to lower taxes for all tax classes.\n\nFocus on single-parent families and the lowest wages\n\nThe tax scales applying to individuals falling into tax class 1a – mainly single parents entitled to a child boni, widows and taxpayers aged more than 64 at the beginning of the tax year – will be separately reviewed to adapt and lower the level of income tax. For instance, the first tax bracket, with no tax applicable, should increase from EUR 24,876 to EUR 26,460.\n\nOn top of that, 2 tax credits will be adjusted and increased:\n\n– The Single Parent Tax Credit (“Crédit d’impôt Monoparental CIM”): The maximum amount should increase from EUR 2,505 to EUR 3,504. The new formula is supposed to neutralise the income taxes due up to an annual gross salary EUR 52,400. Note that the CIM is applicable upon request and under certain conditions, at payroll level or at tax return level.\n\n– The Social Minimum Wage Tax Credit (“Crédit d’Impôt Salaire Social Minimum CISSM”): The amount should be revised so that employees earning the minimum wage for non-qualified workers have no tax liability, in all tax classes. Today, the minimum salary is EUR 2,570.93. When the next indexation applies – expected at the end of 2024 – it will increase to EUR 2,635.21.\n\nExamples\n\nTax savings compared to 2024\n\nThe revision of the annual tax scales because of indexation should be a clear tax saving for all tax classes, particularly those on the lowest income.\n\nVialto comments: The decrease of the personal tax liability will certainly be appreciated by Luxembourg taxpayers. We see that a specific additional tax relief will apply for taxpayers subject to tax class 1a (essentially the single parents).\nThe promised and more ambitious reform of the individual tax system (revamping of the current discriminatory tax classes system) is still to come.\n\nIncreasing the attractivity of Luxembourg\n\nNew inpatriate tax regime\n\nThe current inpatriate regime aims at exempting from taxation part or all of the relocation benefits and premiums paid to an employee hired from abroad or seconded to Luxembourg, provided that the employee and the company meet specific eligibility criteria. Certain ceilings also apply in the amounts to tax exempt, depending on the nature of the benefits/premiums paid.\n\nWhat is proposed through the new (simplified) inpatriate regime as from 2025 is to have 50% of the gross annual remuneration tax free, limited to EUR 400,000. This approach aligns Luxembourg with similar regimes in other EU countries (e.g. The Netherlands or Spain). The conditions to be eligible to the new inpatriate regime remained basically unchanged, except that the employee has to exercise the activity for which he is benefiting from the regime for at least 75% of the working time.\n\nThe current regime will continue to apply to those employees moving to Luxembourg in 2024 and who are eligible for the regime unless they opt to the new regime applicable from 2025. In such a case, the choice will be irrevocable.\n\nVialto comments: The goal seems to improve and simplify the current inpatriate regime – to allow Luxembourg employer to recruit easier talents from abroad. This goes in the good direction as we see that a lot of Luxembourg employers do not apply it (for various reasons) and/or do not optimize in an appropriate way the current regime, which is already very attractive.\n\nNew Profit-sharing Scheme\n\nThis mechanism allows companies to pay a 50% tax free participation premium to their employees providing that certain conditions are fulfilled. With the new tax measures, as from 2025, the total amount that can be allocated to employees as part of the scheme could increase from 5% to 7.5% of the profits of the employing company in year Y-1.  In addition, the ceiling of the maximum premium to be paid per employee could increase from 25% to 30% of the employee’s annual gross fixed remuneration (excl. benefits and non-periodic payments).\n\nVialto comments: The increase of the ceiling is appreciated. However, this system of “primes participatives” still seems discriminatory as only employees working for (very) profitable companies can be entitled to this favorable tax regime.\n\nCosts for the maintenance and education of children who are not part of the taxpayer’s household\n\nThe maximum deduction of costs per child (which have already been increased from EUR 4,020 to EUR 4,422 as from tax year 2023) should be increased again and up to EUR 5,424.\n\nDeduction of mortgage interest in connection with the acquisition of a primary residence already existing\n\nAs from tax year 2024, mortgage interest paid on the acquisition of a pre-existing property for the purposes of using it as a primary residence should be deductible without any ceiling for the year of acquisition and the following year. Thereafter, there should be ceilings of EUR 4,000, EUR 3,000 and EUR 2,000 applying, depending on how long the property has been occupied.\n\nVialto comments: Interesting provision – but with effects very limited in time (only applying for 2 years).\n\nIntroduction of a new premium for young employees aged less than 30 years old\n\nAs from 1 June 2024, a new paragraph 13c was already added to article 115 LITL, allowing, under certain conditions (one of which is to be under the age of 30), the tax exemption of a “rental premium” paid by the employer. The new tax relief package also adds a provision as from 2025 to help employees who should be 30 years’ old maximum, where a specific premium allocated by the employer will be 75% exempted. The said premium is capped as follows:\n\nVialto comments: It will certainly be interesting tax wise to apply for the employers. Its concrete application will raise some questions. It may seem discriminatory to apply this favorable tax regime only to some employees based on their age. Indeed, a 28 years old employee who earns EUR 100k will be entitled to it while another 32 years old employee who earns EUR 40K/year will not.\n\nTax credit on overtime for cross-border workers\n\nA new tax credit of a maximum of EUR 700 will be implemented for non-resident employees working and being paid for overtime. This new measure is likely connected to the recent clarification obtained from the German tax authorities about the taxation of Luxembourg exempted overtime for German cross-borders (see our Bulletin in that respect). The tax credit will be requested at tax return level.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nEric Paques \nPartner\n\nDenise Chambers\nDirector\n\nMichael Roser\nSenior Manager\n\nQuentin Cosco\nManager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nMalaysia | Deployment of e-Services by Malaysian inland revenue board\n\nSummary\nThe MIRB has recently issued an official mandate to implement a new practice, whereby electronic services (e-Services) will be gradually integrated through their official portal (myTax) for all taxation matters. This initiative is in accordance with the government’s goal to systematically enhance digitalisation and improve their customer service standards. The phased introduction of e-Services started on 1 September 2023, with complete implementation expected by 1 January 2024. Nevertheless, at present, the MIRB’s customer service officers will persist in assisting taxpayers with their tax-related matters at the HASiL Service Counter in MIRB’s offices while making efforts to inform and prepare taxpayers for the full adoption of e-Services.\n\nThe Detail\nAs specified in their official website, the MIRB has outlined the e-Services that are mandatory to be used in stages starting 1 September 2023, encompassing the following:\n\nTax obligation for the employers\n\nTax obligation for the taxpayers\n\nTax Payments\nFurthermore, the MIRB strongly recommends the employers and taxpayers to utilise any of the approved online payment methods available for secure, systematic, and quick transactions which are as follows:\n\nHow we can help\nIt is anticipated that with the eventual full integration of e-Services, the conventional practice of manually completing and submitting hard-copy tax documents to the MIRB will be progressively eliminated as MIRB continuously introduces new e-Services along the way. As such, we can support employers and employees in familiarising themselves with the appropriate procedures and safeguards in utilising e-Services to accomplish and submit relevant tax documents for each respective taxation matter.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nHilda Liow\nPartner\n\nLim Phing Phing\nPartner\n\nWee Lay Har\nDirector\n\nHuang I-Hsiang\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "24 January 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nThe Detail\n\nIn 2023, the non-cash benefit values will be increased to the following amounts:\n\nValue in kind for meals\n\nIf employees receive benefits in kind from their employer (e.g., meals provided to employees free of charge or at a reduced price every working day or free accommodation), these are subject to wage tax as non-cash benefits. This also applies to meals which are subject to wage tax and provided to the employee by the employer or by a third party at the employer’s request during a business trip or during a double housekeeping, provided that the value of the meal does not exceed EUR 60.\n\nThe employer may tax the non-cash benefit at a flat tax rate of 25% (plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge and, if applicable, flat-rate church tax). For the calculation of the taxable benefit in kind, the official benefit values (according to the Social Security Remuneration Ordinance SvEV) are to be used. If the flat-rate wage tax is applied, the benefit in kind is exempt from social security contributions.\n\nThe values have changed as follows from 2023:\n\n● Lunch or dinner:       3.80 EUR / calendar day\n● Breakfast:                  2.00 EUR / calendar day\n● Full day meals:         9.60 EUR / calendar day\n\nThis results in a monthly value for meals of EUR 288 as of 01.01.2023.\n\nThe new non-cash benefit values for 2023 are already applicable from the first payroll month of 2023 and are subject to both tax and social security contributions.\n\nIf the employee receives meal vouchers from the employer, the settlement value or the employer’s allowance per lunch may exceed the official non-cash benefit value by a maximum of EUR 3.10. This means that the value of the meal voucher may be at a maximum of EUR 6.90.\n\nValue in kind for accommodation\n\nSince January 1, 2023 the monthly non-cash benefit value for free or reduced-price accommodation is EUR 265. The value of the accommodation can also be assessed with the locally cheaper rent if the value would be unreasonable according to the situation of the individual case.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n• Anna Liepelt, Senior Manager | anna.l.liepelt@vialto.com\n• Isabell Gelder, Senior Associate | isabell.g.gelder@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "April 10, 2025",
        "content": "Social Security\n\nSummary\n\nChina has recently implemented key changes integrating foreign work permits with social security cards, making a significant shift in compliance requirements for foreign nationals working in China. This move aims to streamline processes while reinforcing a more structured and monitored framework for social security contributions. For higher education institutions (HEIs) with employees working in China, understanding these updates is critical. The integration may heighten compliance risks, making it essential to review current employment arrangements and ensure proactive management of obligations.\n\nThe detail\n\nUnder Chinese legislation, all foreign employees—regardless of their employment arrangement (i.e., locally hired or seconded)—must register and contribute to the Chinese social security system. This typically includes pension, medical, work injury, unemployment, and maternity insurance. Generally, employers are required to process these contributions through a local Chinese bank account registered under the company’s name. Compliance with these regulations is essential to avoid potential penalties.\n\nMany overseas universities deliver joint education programs in China through a Joint Education Program (JEP) or Joint Education Institution (JEI). However, compliance with China’s social security obligations for faculty and employees remains a challenge for some institutions.\n\nKey considerations\n\nIntegrated system\n\nEffective December 2024, China will phase out physical work permit cards for foreign nationals. Instead, work permit details will be fully digitized and integrated into the electronic Social Security system, accessible via a dedicated mobile app. This shift underscores China’s move toward streamlined digital administration – ensuring easier access for foreign nationals while reinforcing compliance tracking. Please refer to the detailed Vialto Insight on this matter here.\n\nStricter compliance requirements and increased scrutiny\n\nThe integration of foreign work permits with social security cards signals a new era of stricter enforcement. This digital consolidation gives authorities enhanced monitoring capabilities, likely resulting in:\n\nHow can we help\n\nTo ensure compliance with China’s evolving regulatory landscape, we advise HEIs to:\n\nConduct a comprehensive review of current social security contributions, including any applicable totalization agreements and alignment with work permits.\n\nIdentify and address gaps where past obligations may have been overlooked—particularly as stricter enforcement takes effect in 2025.\n\nVialto Partners is ready to assist with liaising with local authorities to resolve compliance issues and mitigating risks tied to the new integrated system.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nJacky Chu\nPartner, China Leader\n\nJames Shen\nDirector, Tax\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "content": "Immigration and Employment Tax\n\nHong Kong | Policy Address 2024 — Reform to grow\n\nSummary\n\nOn October 16, 2024, the Chief Executive (“the CE”) of Hong Kong SAR, Mr. John Lee, delivered the 2024 Hong Kong Policy Address (“the Policy Address”). To consolidate and enhance Hong Kong SAR’s status as an international financial, shipping and trade centre, the Policy Address has introduced specific measures for strengthening our existing business, as well as exploring new growth areas. To support business growth, talent attraction and retention remains a key agenda.\n\nThe detail\n\nTrawl for talents\n\nWith a projected shortage of talents across different sectors in the next five years, the CE has announced the reformation in respect of various aspects of the talent admission regime.\n\nHong Kong immigration facilitation for talent attraction\n\nGeneral Employment Policy (GEP)\n\nThe Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (ASMTP)\n\nQuality Migrant Admission Scheme (QMAS)\n\n\n\nUnder QMAS, eligible applicants who meet the requirements of the Talent List will be awarded 30 bonus points under the General Points Test.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.     International financial centre\n\n2.     International innovation and technology centre\n\n3.    East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange\n\n4.    International trade centre\n\n5.    International shipping centre\n\n6.    International aviation hub\n\n7.     Centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region\n\n8.    Regional intellectual property trading centre\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (ASMTP)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther immigration facilitation\n\nOther Hong Kong immigration facilitation\n\n\n\ncounting investments made through an eligible private company wholly owned by an applicant towards the applicant’s eligible investment with effect from March 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n–          Extending the validity period of multiple-entry visas for these countries from two years to three years;\n\n–          Expediting the processing of visa applications from group visitors of ASEAN countries submitted via local travel agents; and\n\n–          Providing self-service immigration clearance for invited persons participating in business, development and related activities from the 10 ASEAN countries.\n\n\n\nEmployment tax measures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur observation\n\nIn light of the current global economic challenges and worldwide territorial competition for talents, the focused facilitation measures proposed in the Policy Address is welcome news to employers of different sectors. With the enhanced immigration facilitation measures, employers can retain and attract overseas talents more effectively and efficiently.\n\nWe believe details about the new channels under GEP and ASMTP proposed in the Policy Address for attracting talents from specific sectors will be announced shortly. Employers may stay tuned for any further updates. Vialto will provide updates once available.\n\nAlthough the validity period of the first visa of high-income talents (Category A) under TTPS will be extended to three years, current TTPS visa holders are still required to apply for visa extension by the current visa expiry dates. Employers should keep track of the visa expiry dates of all the employees holding TTPS visas and ensure timely renewal.\n\nWith the facilitation measures for inbound travels, we expect a significant increase in the number of visitors from Mainland China and ASEAN countries. Employers and employees should be mindful of the activities allowable to be conducted during the visitors’ stays in Hong Kong and apply for the appropriate visas to facilitate them to carry out the activities in Hong Kong, where applicable.\n\nExtensive presence in Hong Kong may also trigger tax filing obligations on employers and employees. To avoid any doubts about the visa needs and tax compliance, employers are suggested to have a robust system in place in order to track, review, and approve requests for business travels.\n\nOn the employment tax front, it is noteworthy that the direction is to continue attracting funds and family offices to Hong Kong by offering more tax incentives, and improving employment rights on minimum wage, employment benefits, retirement benefit investment choice, family-friendly practices, middle-aged and elderly persons’ re-employment and upskilling.\n\nThe measures outlined in the Policy Address will steer Hong Kong toward the right path, fostering a stable environment for growth and development. With these initiatives in place, they will create the foundation for long-term prosperity, enabling both businesses and individuals to thrive in an increasingly competitive and dynamic world.\n\n\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nJames Clemence\nAsia Pacific CEO\n\nBruce Lee\nPartner, Hong Kong Territory Leader\n\nAdam Chiu\nPartner\n\nLouis Lam\nPartner\n\nSteven Lim\nPartner\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

Changes should be communicated to employees, with consideration given to employer communications / FAQ documents etc, particularly where employees are responsible for their own tax reporting.\n\nChina | Preferential policy extension to equity incentives\nA reminder that the Extension of Individual Income Tax (IIT) Preferential Treatment on Equity Incentive Income, MOF STA Public Notice [2023] No.25 (PN25), providing the preferential tax policy on equity incentive income will continue to be extended until 31 December 2027.\n\nAs a recap of the preferential policy, the IIT preferential treatment for equity incentive income allows a separate taxation method without adding it to the comprehensive income received by tax residents. Under this calculation method, the individual generally benefits from a tax savings as the equity incentive income will not be added to the regular income for tax calculation purposes and hence a lower tax rate could be applied.\n\nThe Takeaways\nCompanies who adopt the preferential treatment should pay attention to the followings:\n\nCzech Republic | Amended Income Tax Acts\nAs of 1 January 2024, the amended Income Taxes Act came into force, and introduced significant changes to the taxation of the employee equity-based plans.\n\nThe amended legislation applies to employees who acquire shares or options from their employer, or from this employer’s parent company, subsidiary, or other related joint-stock corporation.\n\nThe amended law explicitly defines the taxable moment of the non-monetary benefit for employees and provides for tax deferral. The taxable moment, that was absent in the tax legislation until now, has been completely redefined for most situations. Possible taxable moments are:\n\nThe above taxable moments may differ from the tax treatment applied until the end of 2023 i.e., imposing tax at the vest of shares, or at the exercise of options. The “new” taxable moments may occur significantly later.\n\nThe Takeaways\nEmployees are now obliged to inform their employer about the transfer (sale) of shares or options by the end of the calendar month in which the transfer took place. For example, if an individual performs a “cashless” exercise (i.e. an exercise and immediate sale of the underlying shares), the taxable moment will arise at that time. However, there are other facts that might be difficult or even impossible to determine in a timely manner for the employer, such as a change of tax residence. It can be expected that the employer will often be delayed with the relevant tax payments and will thus be subject to possible sanctions.\n\nFurthermore, it will be necessary to monitor changes in the shares’ market price, as the amended law allows (under certain conditions), to consider reducing the value of shares to be taxed. This again imposes additional administrative requirements on the employer and responsibility for determining the correct amount of taxable income. At this time, there is no prescribed threshold for how much of a decline in stock price will allow for a reduction in the taxable amount. The employee must inform the employer as of the date of sale of the shares.\n\nWe recommend to all the employers who are involved in the equity-based plans of their employees (i.e., manage the equity-based plans, or bear the relevant costs) to inform their employees in advance of their obligations, including to notify the employer of when a sale of shares occurs.\n\nWhere shares or options are acquired from another company in the group that is not considered a Czech taxpayer and the related equity costs are not borne by the Czech employer, the employee will be obliged to report this income in his/her tax return for the taxable period in which one of the taxable moments occurs. The employees will thus need to keep proper evidence of their equity disposal or change in the stock price.\n\nConsidering the possible shift of the taxable moment as of 2024, where taxable moments may arise many years after the shares vested / options were exercised, the logic of who should be authorized for the Czech tax return preparation due to trailing income should also be reviewed.\n\nThe Czech tax authorities are already discussing possible adjustments to the above and some of the taxable moments may be changed or completely removed from the law in the future.\n\nThe above changes have not been reflected in the Czech social security and health insurance laws. The relevant taxable moment for the contributions remains the same as in 2023 (vesting of shares or exercise of the options) and can lead to different moments for income taxation and for payment of mandatory public insurances.\n\nKorea | Stock-based Compensation Changes and Notice of Legislative Action\nAs of 1 January 2024, stock-based compensation issued to employees will trigger additional reporting requirements. Amendments to the Enforcement Decree of the Income Tax Act (the “ITA Enforcement Decree”) pursuant to the amendments of the Income Tax Act, now mean that stock-based compensation granted to the Korean resident employees by overseas parent company (or the overseas controlling shareholder) must be reported to the National Tax Service of Korea.\n\nThe Korean employer entity must submit the transaction details (e.g., details of grant, exercise and payment of share based compensation) by 10 March of the year following the taxable period when the exercise or payment of stock based compensation occurred. This rule will be applied to stock-based compensation exercised (or paid) on or after 1 January 2024.\n\nNotice of Legislative Action\nOn 29 December 2023, the Financial Services Commission (the “FSC”), which is the competent government ministry with regulatory oversight over the Financial Services and Capital Markets Act (the “FSCMA Enforcement Decree”), issued an advance notice of legislative action which will allow Korean resident employees of multinational companies, who acquired the securities through the stock- based compensation program, to dispose of overseas-listed securities without using Korean licensed brokers.\n\nThis notice comes in response to the concerns expressed over regulatory uncertainty caused by the June 2023 rule issued by the Financial Supervisory Service (the “FSS”), which, amongst other things, required employees to open a domestic broker account and request to transfer their foreign-listed shares from their foreign broker account to their domestic broker account in order to be compliant with the regulatory changes.\n\nThe proposed legislative action will take the form of an amendment to Article 184(1) of the FSCMA Enforcement Decree and may become effective as of late February or early March 2024 once it is promulgated after a public comment process.\n\nContact us\nThank you to our local colleagues for their support in drafting this update.

        "title": "Switzerland | Immigration | Caution advised as scams targeting migrants reported",
        "date": "May 3, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSwitzerland – Caution advised as scams targeting migrants reported\n\nSummary\n\nCounterfeit correspondence, which alleges immigration status revocation of migrants in Switzerland, is currently being reported across Switzerland. Suspected racial targeting of the scam are currently under scrutiny by officials and being stated as a possible motivation. It is advised that migrants currently working in Switzerland are aware of this scam and reach out to their immigration provider if they receive any direct communication about their immigration status being revoked.\n\nThe Detail\n\nBeware: Fraudulent Residence Status Letters\n\nIn recent developments, fraudulent communications falsely attributed to the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) have emerged, targeting foreign nationals domiciled within Swiss territory. These deceitful correspondences announce the impending revocation of recipients’ Swiss residence permits, supposedly under the auspices of the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons (ALCP), by the conclusion of the calendar year.\n\nThe gravity of this situation cannot be overstated, as these counterfeit missives bear all the hallmarks of official correspondence and command attention with their subject line, “you must leave Switzerland by the end of the year”. The inclusion of SEM’s logo, coupled with the utilization of legal terminology, initially lends an air of authenticity to the letters. Notably, a QR code is visible on the communication, linking to SEM resources. However, recipients are firmly warned against its activation due to potential security threats. SEM, through its official channels, has unequivocally stated its intent to pursue legal action against the authors of these fraudulent documents.\n\nThe safeguard clause on the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons (ALCP)\n\nThe mention of B and C permits (although incorrectly), alongside ongoing negotiations with the European Union concerning Bilateral Agreements, makes this letter even more credible as it emphasizes the intricate legal landscape surrounding Swiss immigration policy. The invocation of the safeguard clause within the ALCP, a provision that exists and may be used under exceptional circumstances is of particular concern. It is said that the Swiss government supposedly activates this clause retroactively. Recipients are then instructed to report to SEM or their respective cantonal migration offices within a limited timeframe, with the looming threat of residency permit revocation.\n\nSuspicion of racial targeting\n\nThe receipt of approximately twenty depositions by SEM, alongside analogous complaints lodged with cantonal authorities, has catalyzed suspicions of racial discrimination. Given the selective targeting of non-Swiss nationals in possession of valid permits, conjectures regarding the discriminatory drive underlying these means have arisen. The potential motivations behind this scheme remain vague, prompting inquiries into potential xenophobic or politically motivated agendas.\n\nSEM’s declaration of its intent to pursue charges against the perpetrators underscores the severity of the situation, with potential criminal charges including document forgery and coercion looming large.\n\nIn conclusion, it is imperative that all stakeholders remain vigilant in the face of these fraudulent activities, and that appropriate legal measures are taken to address and mitigate the potential harm caused by such deceptive practices.\n\nHow we can help\n\nOur dedicated Swiss immigration team is committed to ensuring your business stays compliant with evolving regulations and is here to support any immigration concern.\n\nWe offer a proactive approach, including assessments and expert guidance, including but not limited to:\n\nStrategic advisory services\n\nTailored training for HR and recruitment teams\n\nComprehensive audit on current recruitment process\n\nPublications and recommendations\n\nNegotiation with authorities\n\nPrior assessment and review of proof of research before submission\n\nHave questions?

        "title": "Belgium | Revised Supernota De Wever",
        "date": "October 25, 2024",
        "content": "Global Mobility Tax\n\nSummary\n\nIn the wake of the provincial, municipal and district elections, negotiations for the formation of a new federal government in Belgium have resumed.\n\nAs highlighted in our previous newsletter, Bart De Wever, leader of the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and responsible for forming a new federal government in Belgium, put forward his so-called socio-economic “supernote” during the summer of 2024. This plan outlined significant potential reforms with respect to pensions, labor market and the Belgian tax system.\n\nAfter negotiations stalled in August on the proposed tax reform, De Wever has spent the recent months reworking compromises between the five Arizona parties. Recently, a revised version of the “supernota” was leaked wherein some proposals from the first supernote have been changed or are no longer on the table. Below is an overview of the key personal income tax-related measures from the updated supernote.\n\nKey points Supernota De Wever\n\nProfessional income and family taxation\n\nIncreased lump-sum tax free allowance\n\nAn increase is proposed of the lump-sum tax-free allowance to an amount of EUR 12.000 by 2029. Currently, the lump-sum tax free allowance amounts to EUR 10.570. The increase would provide a net saving of EUR 357,50 (calculated as EUR 1.430 x 25%).\n\nTax brackets and rates\n\nThe revised supernote includes a new adjustment of the progressive tax brackets. Presently, the Belgian personal income tax consists of four rates: 25% (0 – 15.820 €), 40% (15.820 – 27.920 €), 45% (27.920 – 48.320 €) and 50% (above 48.320 €). The updated plan proposes abolishing the highest rate of 50%. Additionally, a new (but rather limited) tax bracket of 35% is introduced, alongside an upward adjustment of the income thresholds. The new structure would feature the following rates: 25% (0–16,000 €), 35% (16,000–21,000 €), 40% (21,000–30,000 €), and 45% (above 30,000 €).\n\nThese changes will primarily benefit high earners and the impact for the individuals with a low income will be rather limited.\n\nThe abolition of the marital quotient\n\nDe Wever proposes phasing out the marital quotient tax benefit for non-pensioners. This was also part of the initial supernote as well as the proposed tax reform of resigning Minister of Finance Vincent Van Peteghem (CD&V).\n\nThe Belgian marital quotient is a tax mechanism that allows married or legally cohabiting couples to shift up to 30% of the higher-earning spouse’s income to the lower-earning (or non-earning) spouse, reducing their overall tax burden by taking advantage of the progressive tax brackets. This change would have a significant impact for couples where one partner earns little or no income.\n\nJob bonus\n\nDe Wever seeks to adjust the fiscal job bonus – a tax benefit for low-wage earners – so that the lowest earners would receive maximum support, leaving them with more take-home pay.\n\nComeback of the “Carenzdag”\n\nA new proposal in the revised supernote is the comeback of the “Carenzdag”. The “Carenzdag”, which previously existed in Belgium, stipulated that blue collar workers were not paid for their first day of sick leave. As white-collar workers were compensated for their first day of sick leave, the “Carenzday” was abolished in 2014 due to this disparity. De Wever now proposes reintroducing the system to discourage misuse of short-term absences without a doctor’s note. It is anticipated that the new “Carenzdag” would apply to both blue- and white-collar workers.\n\nReinforcing of meal vouchers\n\nThe plan also includes reinforcing meal vouchers by increasing their value and expanding the range of spending options.\n\nOn the other hand, all other types of vouchers (i.e. eco vouchers, consumption vouchers, culture vouchers; …) will be abolished.\n\nAbolition of special social security contributions\n\nThe abolishing of the special social security contribution, a contribution which was introduced back in 1994 as an additional funding of the Belgian social security, remains part of De Wever’s supernote.\n\nAutomatic wage indexation remains in place (for now)\n\nThe automatic wage indexation system, which adjusts salaries to match increases in the cost of living, will be maintained for the time being. However, De Wever is contemplating a reform of the system and has requested the social partners to provide their recommendations on the matter by the end of 2026.\n\nManagement companies / self-employed persons\n\nAddressing the improper use of management companies\n\nAs more and more executives establish management companies to optimize their tax situation in Belgium, Mr. De Wever proposes measures to curb this practice. One key measure would be increasing the minimum managerial remuneration (towards the company director) from EUR 45.000 to EUR 50.000, and subject to further indexation, in order to qualify for the reduced corporate income tax rate of 20%.\n\nIn the first version of the supernote, a phasing out of the current VVPRbis system, which (under certain conditions) allows management companies to distribute dividends at a reduced movable tax rate, was proposed. However, this proposal has been omitted from the revised supernote, indicating that the VVPRbis system will likely remain unchanged.\n\nNew deduction for self-employed individuals\n\nThe supernote introduces a new deduction for self-employed individuals (ondernemersaftrek/déduction pour entrepreneurs), allowing to deduct 10% of their gains or profits from their taxes, with a maximum of 10.000 EUR. This is a reduction from the initial proposal, which allowed for a 20% deduction, with a maximum of EUR 20,000.\n\nTaxation of movable (savings and investment) income\n\nReform movable withholding tax\n\nCurrently, there is a tax exemption on interest income from regulated saving accounts (up to €1,020 per person) and taxpayers can reclaim withheld movable taxes on dividends (up to EUR 249,90 per person) through their annual personal income tax returns.\n\nIn the initial supernote, De Wever proposed expanding the existing tax exemption to cover interest income from other accounts, state bonds, and other types of movable income, such as dividend income, within a broad tax-exempt basket. However, the revised supernote abolishes the tax exemption altogether. Instead, it introduces a new system where no movable income is tax-exempt, but withheld movable taxes can be reclaimed through the tax return up to a yet-to-be-determined amount (estimated between €1,000 and €2,000). This will apply to all forms of movable income (interest, coupons, dividends), leading to several significant changes:\n\nIntroduction of a capital gains tax\n\nThe introduction of a capital gains tax was a major sticking point in previous federal government negotiations. Despite this, it remains in De Wever’s supernote, as Belgium is currently one of the few countries where such gains are not taxed under certain conditions.\n\nThe new proposal includes the same 10% capital gains tax on the sale of financial assets such as shares and bonds. The costs incurred to acquire these capital gains would be deductible, and small investors would be spared. According to the revised supernote, the first EUR 15,000 of capital gains will be exempt from taxation. However, this threshold is still under discussion, and the question arises whether solely raising the tax-free threshold from EUR 6,000 to EUR 10,000 will be enough to gain the support of the parties, like the MR, which previously opposed the introduction of the capital gain tax.\n\nTax on stock exchange (TOB)\n\nThe transaction tax on buying and selling securities will be reformed. Shares of small companies will be exempt from this tax, and shares from newly listed companies will be exempt for five years. Additionally, the tax rates of the tax on stock exchange transactions will be harmonized.\n\nTax on securities accounts\n\nAt present, there is a 0,15% tax on securities accounts with balances exceeding 1 million euros. De Wever proposes raising the tax rate to 0.20%. However, on the other hand, the supernote also suggests that the tax on securities accounts could be abolished if the capital gains tax generates sufficient revenue.\n\nTaxation of immovable income\n\nTaxation of actual rental income\n\nFor many years now, private individuals who rent out property for non-professional purposes are taxed progressively (via their tax return) on the deemed rental income of the property, which is indexed and increased with 40%. This taxation method is beneficial, because the actual (often higher) rental income is not taxed.\n\nIn the first version of the supernote, there were no proposals to alter this system. However, the revised supernote indicates De Wever’s desire to adjust the taxable basis for real estate income. The intention would not be to tax the actual rental income, but to make an adjustment to the existing system, such as increasing the 40% rate used to calculate the taxable real estate income. It remains unclear whether these changes will apply to second residences or only to properties beyond the second residence. Primary residences will continue to be exempt from personal income taxes.\n\nPhase-out of federal interest deduction\n\nAs from January 1, 2024, there are no more tax benefits for capital repayments and life insurance premiums related to loans for non-primary residences. However, it is currently still possible to claim the federal interest deduction for paid interests. De Wever’s supernote proposes phasing out this federal interest deduction.\n\nThe negotiations continue\n\nThe discussions continue and although Belgium received an extension from the European Commission to submit its budget plan, an agreement must be reached as soon as possible as the new government hopes to introduce the reforms as early as January 1 2025. Is a solution finally in the making and will the parties find a common ground for governance?

        "date": "January 27, 2025",
        "content": "The most important changes for employers around wage tax for 2025 at a glance.\n\nAbolition of the one-fifth rule\n\nThe Growth Opportunities Act abolishes the obligation to apply the one-fifth rule from January 1, 2025 within payroll reporting. However, it can still be applied as part of the employee’s income tax assessment. This is intended to reduce the workload for companies. However, the 2025 template of the annual wage tax statement still requires a certification of multi-year wages and pension payments, as well as of indemnity payments such as severance pay.\n\nIncrease in the basic tax-free allowance\n\nAmong other things, the Tax Reform Act now includes an increase of the basic tax-free bracket for 2025 and 2026 to €12,069 and €12,348 respectively as well as an increase of the monthly child benefit to €255 (2025) and €259 (2026). Furthermore, the exemption limit for the solidarity surcharge has been raised to income tax amounts of €19,950 and €20,350 for 2025 and 2026 respectively. The transfer of tax class combinations 3 and 5 to the factor method has not been implemented.\n\nTax measures to support those affected by the war in Ukraine\n\nThe period of application of the BMF circulars on tax measures to support those affected by the war in Ukraine will be extended to 2025.\n\nBenefits in kind for meals and accommodation\n\nThe non-cash benefit values for meals have been increased. Full day meals are now valued at EUR 11.10 per calendar day. The non-cash benefit value for lunch or dinner is €4.40 and for breakfast €2.30. The values are already to be taken into account from January 2025 and are subject to both tax and social contributions.\n\nDie wichtigsten Neuerungen für Arbeitgeber im Bereich Lohnsteuer für das Jahr 2025 auf einen Blick.\n\nAbschaffung der Fünftelregelung\n\nDas Wachstumschancengesetz lässt ab dem 01. Januar 2025 die Anwendung der Fünftelregelung im Rahmen der Lohnabrechnung entfallen. Sie kann allerdings noch im Rahmen der Einkommensteuerveranlagung des Arbeitnehmers angewandt werden. Damit soll der Prüfungs- und Berechnungsaufwand der Unternehmen verringert werden. Allerdings sehen die Muster der Lohnsteuerbescheinigung 2025 weiterhin eine Bescheinigungspflicht für Arbeitslohn und Versorgungsbezüge für mehrere Jahre sowie für Entschädigungen wie z.B. Abfindungen vor.\n\nErhöhung des Grundfreibetrags\n\nDas Steuerfortentwicklungsgesetz umfasst nun unter anderem eine Erhöhung des Grundfreibetrags für die Jahre 2025 und 2026 auf 12.069 € bzw. 12.348 € sowie die Erhöhung des monatlichen Kindergelds auf 255 € (2025) bzw. 259 € (2026). Weiterhin wurde die Freigrenze des Solidaritätszuschlags für die Jahre 2025 und 2026 auf Einkommensteuerbeträge von 19.950 € bzw. 20.350 € angehoben. Gestrichen wurde die Überführung der Steuerklassenkombination 3 und 5 in das Faktorverfahren.\n\nSteuerliche Maßnahmen zur Unterstützung der vom Krieg in der Ukraine Geschädigten\n\nDer zeitliche Anwendungsbereich der BMF-Schreiben zu steuerlichen Maßnahmen zur Unterstützung der vom Krieg in der Ukraine Geschädigten wird auf das Jahr 2025 verlängert.\n\nSachbezugswerte Mahlzeiten und Unterkunft\n\nDie Sachbezugswerte für Mahlzeiten wurden erhöht. Kalendertäglich sind nun Mahlzeiten für den ganzen Tag in Höhe von 11,10 EUR anzusetzen. Der Sachbezugswert für ein Mittag- oder Abendessen beträgt 4,40 EUR und für ein Frühstück 2,30 EUR. Die Werte sind bereits ab Januar 2025 zu berücksichtigen und sind sowohl steuer- als auch beitragspflichtig.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMathias Schmitt\nPartner, Steuerberater\n\nAnna Liepelt\nSenior Manager, Steuerberaterin\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "content": "28 July 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs (the Department) has confirmed that Labour Market Testing (LMT) is not required for Temporary Skills Shortage (TSS) visa applications where the nominee is a UK citizen or permanent resident.\n\nThe Detail\n\nThe Australia-UK Free Trade Agreement (AUKFTA) came into force on 31 May 2023 making it easier for Australian and UK businesses to establish operations in each country and to share workforce labour across the two nations (amongst other things).\n\nThis included a reciprocal commitment to waive LMT requirements, which is generally required for most TSS (subclass 482) visa applications.  As a result, the Department confirmed a blanket exemption from LMT requirements for all UK citizens and permanent residents.\n\nAfter much conjecture and varying opinions on the Department’s blanket-exemption position, the Department amended its communication on 11 July 2023 to confirm that the LMT exemption would only apply to those in one of the LMT exempt categories under the relevant International Trade Obligation.  This resulted in uncertainty for business sponsors as to whether an exemption would apply to all UK citizens and permanent residents due to the complexity and wording of the trade agreement.\n\nAs a result of significant advocacy and a call for the Department to provide a clear position on the subject, the Department’s Employer Sponsored Program Delivery team has confirmed that there is an LMT exemption available for all applicants who are UK citizens or permanent residents.\n\nThis means that business sponsors no longer need to provide evidence of LMT in relation to a TSS application where the nominee (employee) is a UK citizen or permanent resident.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nStacey Tsui, Partner & Principal Solicitor: stacey.tsui@vialto.com\n\nCherie Wright, Partner: cherie.wright@vialto.com\n\nAnnalisa Symons, Director: annalisa.symons@vialto.com\n\nRachel Williamson, Director: rachel.williamson@vialto.com\n\nFariha.Islam, Director: fariha.islam@vialto.com\n\nJohn O’Brien, Senior Manager: john.d.obrien@vialto.com\n\nArathi Tekkam, Senior Manager: arathi.tekkam@vialto.com\n\nBen Reid, Senior Manager: ben.reid@vialto.com\n\nMerridy Parr, Senior Manager: merridy.a.parr@vialto.com\n\nDee Le, Manager: dee.t.le@vialto.com\n\nKrishneel Ram, Manager: krishneel.ram@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "January 4, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nGermany | Benefit values for free or reduced-price meals from 2024\n\nSummary\nIn 2024, the official benefit in kind values will be increased. If employees receive benefits in kind from their employer (e.g., meals that are provided to employees free of charge or at a reduced price every working day), these are generally subject to wage tax and social security as non-cash benefits. This also applies to taxable meals that are provided to the employee by the employer or by a third party during a business trip or as part of a double household, provided the value of the meal does not exceed EUR 60.\n\nThe Detail\nIf daily meals are provided free of charge or the employee’s payment for a meal does not reach the non-cash benefit value, a benefit subject to wage tax and social security contributions arises. The official non-cash benefit values (in accordance with the Social Security Remuneration Ordinance SvEV) are to be used to calculate the taxable non-cash benefit.\n\nThe following amended values will apply from 1 January 2024:\n\nThe new 2024 benefit in kind values are applicable from the first payroll month of 2024 and are subject to wage tax and social security contributions.\n\nThe employer can tax the non-cash benefit individually or at a flat rate of 25% (plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge and, if applicable, flat-rate church tax). If the flat-rate wage tax is applied, the benefit is exempt from social security contributions.\n\nIf the employee receives meal vouchers from the employer, the value or the employer’s allowance per meal may not exceed the official non-cash benefit value by more than EUR 3,10. This means that the value of the meal voucher for lunch must not exceed EUR 7,23. If the value of the meal voucher exceeds the threshold amount, the meal cannot be taken into account at the official non cash benefit value. The flat wage taxation is also not possible in this case.\n\nThere is no taxable non-cash benefit if the employee pays at least the non-cash benefit value for the meal by himself.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnna Liepelt\nSenior Manager\n\nBrigitte Steinhagen\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit: www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

The ticket will be valid from May 1st 2023, and will enable passengers to travel throughout Germany on local public transport.\n\nThe detail\n\nTo date, no special wage tax regulations have been published. According to the current tax regulations, employers who wish to financially support their employees with the 49-Euro-Ticket have the following options:\n\n1. The employer grants its employees the 49-Euro-Ticket in addition to their wages and pays either part or the full cost of the ticket. In principle, employer subsidies to employees for journeys by public transport, which are paid in addition to the wages owed anyway, are exempt from tax- and social security. This also applies to the 49-Euro Ticket.\n\nNote: caution is advised when structuring the employer subsidy for the 49-Euro-Ticket. Employers who have previously granted a fixed monthly amount as a subsidy for the job ticket should adjust the amount of the subsidy to the 49-Euro-Ticket. Otherwise the excess amount will trigger tax and social security liability.\n\n2. The employer can grant the 49-Euro-Ticket to employees as part of a salary conversion. The taxable non-cash benefit resulting from the reduced or free provision of the job ticket is exempt from tax and social security contributions up to an amount of EUR 50 per month. However, when applying the 50-Euro exemption limit, all benefits in kind received in one month must be considered. If the EUR 50 exemption limit is exhausted by other benefits in kind, taxation must be applied to the ticket. The employer can use the option of flat-rate taxation of either 15% or 25%.\n\nThe employer must certify the job tickets accordingly in the wage tax certificate.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n• Marco Libudda, Director | marco.l.libudda@vialto.com\n\n• Anna Liepelt, Senior Manager | anna.I.liepelt@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

The term ‘home office’ will transition to ‘teleworking’, which broadly encompasses regular work performed by employees using necessary information and communication technology, either at home or at locations other than the employer’s premises.\n\nChanges to social security law\n\n– Changes to statutory provisions on work accidents will differentiate between narrow and broad teleworking contexts. Narrow teleworking includes accidents at an employee’s home, relatives’ homes, or coworking spaces.

However, given the continuation of the war in Ukraine, Revenue has confirmed that the concession will continue to apply for the2023 Irish tax year, subject to the above conditions continuing to be met.\n\nAny individual or relevant entity that avails of these concessional treatments should continue to retain evidence to support compliance with the qualifying conditions.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "March 12, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nUnited States | New USCIS fee rule\n\nSummary\nThe fee schedule from 2016 no longer covers USCIS’ operational costs to timely adjudicate USCIS immigration and naturalization benefits. USCIS needs higher fees to cover the cost of doing business and better avoid the accumulation of future backlogs. USCIS will increase their fees because they largely operate as a fee-funded government organization unlike other government agencies. Approximately 96% of USCIS’ funding is from filing fees, and only about 4% is from congressional appropriations which is mostly used to cover operations and support work as well as federal assistance that includes citizenship and integration grants. This new fee rule is estimated to generate an additional $1.14 billion per year in USCIS revenue compared with the previous fee schedule baseline. USCIS needs this amount as it is necessary to match agency capacity with projected workloads, so that backlogs do not accumulate in the future.\n\nThe detail\nPlease see the following table, showing the most pertinent filing fee changes, which compares the previously enacted fee and the final rule fee that goes into effect on April 1, 2024. For the full list of changes, please refer to: Frequently Asked Questions on the USCIS Fee Rule\n\nFurther changes include:\n\nWhat this means\nEmployers and applicants will now need to pay a different fee based on the form they file to USCIS; these new fees go into effect on April 1, 2024.

By detailing the exact eligibility requirements for an Italian Blue Card, as well as the conditions and limitation for intra-EU mobility, there is now more certainty for employees and employers when applying for an EU Blue Card in Italy.\n\nThese clarifications are in line with the conditions of the recast Directive, which are more favourable than under the previous EU Blue Card Directive. For more information on the changes following the recast, we refer to our alert on the recast EU Blue Card Directive.\n\nThe Italian Government, through the Ministry of the Interior Circular No. 2829 of 28 March 2024, has now provided official clarifications and interpretations on the requirements and documentation for entry and employment of a highly qualified foreign workers under the new EU Blue Card (Decree 152/2023). This is in line with the requirement to transpose the relevant provisions of the recast EU Directive into national law.\n\nThe procedure refers to the non-EU citizens that meet the following alternative requirements:\n\nThe procedure is also applicable for regulated professions under Legislative Decree No 206/2007.\n\nThe documentation provided abroad must be legalized/apostilled and translated into Italian language.\n\nThe Italian employer (applicant) must submit a self-certification of the economic and financial situation (Asseveration), signed by a chartered accountant, lawyer or employment consultant registered in the national professional registers.\n\nThe job offer must have a minimum duration of 6 months (previously the minimum was 12 months) and the salary offered has not be lower than the minimum set by the applicable National Collective Labour Contract (CCNL) and, in any case, not lower than the average gross annual salary recorded by ISTAT.\n\nThe non-EU citizen may change employer before 12 months only if expressly authorized by the Labour Authority (ITL). After 12 months any previous authorization is required.\n\nThe non-EU citizen in possession of EU Blue Card can also perform self-employed activities and in the event of losing the job, the foreign citizen may apply for an unemployment permit of stay.\n\nNon-EU citizens holding an EU Blue Card issued by another EU Country can enter Italy and work for 90 days within a 180-day period, as long as they declare their presence in Italy at the police station within 8 days of arrival.\n\nFurthermore, after residing legally in an EU Country for 12 months (before was 18 months) with an EU Blue Card, a non-EU citizen can enter Italy without a visa to perform a highly qualified job for more than 90 days. However, a Nulla Osta (Work Permit) and a Permit of Stay (EU Blue Card) issued by the competent Italian Immigration Office will be required.\n\nIn addition, seasonal workers, beneficiaries of international protection and holders of a residence permit for research and ICT who reside in Italy on a regular basis can apply for the EU Blue Card. In the case of research and ICT, no documentation is required to prove the highly qualified skills required by law.\n\nFinally, the EU Blue Card includes the possibility to apply for a family permit for dependents with the same duration as the main applicant.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nGiovanni Guidone\nDirector, Italy Immigration Lead\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit: www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Czech Republic | New legislation on taxation of employees’ income from equity plans",
        "date": "March 20, 2025",
        "content": "Global Equity and Reward\n\nSummary\n\nThe President recently signed an amendment of the Czech income tax law affecting the income taxation of employment equity-based compensation realized by employees in the calendar year 2024 and onwards. This may significantly impact the obligations of the companies as well as their employees even retrospectively.\n\nThe detail\n\nA year ago, a deferral of income tax and social tax obligations was introduced for equity-based employee income effective from January 2024 to below taxable moments:\n\nWhile it was subject to taxation at the time of acquisition (i.e. vesting or exercise) until the end of 2023.\n\nRecent legislative changes have once again altered the rules for taxation of employees’ income from equity plans and reintroduced the rules applicable by the end of 2023 just with modifications as follows:\n\nIf the employer decides to defer the Czech income taxation of employees’ equity income, i.e. prefers the procedure of deferral introduced in 2024 (see above), the employer (or the foreign entity administrating the equity plan) must submit an appropriate written notification at the Czech Tax Office. Such notification must be filed separately for each equity tranche/each employee for whom the tax deferral is to be applied within a deadline defined by the law. The tax deferral, if notified appropriately, can be applied even retroactively for equity tranches occurred after 1 January 2024.\n\nIf the employer does not notify the Czech tax Office that the company follows the deferral approach of income taxation, income from equity plans realized by the employees after effectiveness of the new law amendment will be taxable at their acquisition time (similarly to the period prior to the year 2024). However, if the tax deferral is not applied, the income from equity plans realized by the employees during the calendar year 2024 becomes taxable and should be considered as employees’ income of the calendar year 2025.\n\nFor the equity-based income realized in 2024 General Financial Directorate (hereinafter “GFŘ”) has unofficially confirmed that if employers have already included the equity income realized in 2024 in their employees’ 2024 payroll tax calculations, the tax authorities will not challenge this approach. The same benevolence should apply in cases where there is no requirement to keep the income on payroll, and employees decide to include their equity income realized in 2024 in their 2024 personal income tax returns (i.e. rather than into 2025 tax returns as mentioned above).\n\nHow we can help\n\nTaking into account the specifics of your company and employees we can provide you with:\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nPetra Bobková \nDirector\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "title": "Austria | Social Security | New bilateral Framework Agreement on  teleworking with the Czech Republic",
        "date": "February 20, 2023",
        "content": "German version below\n\nAustria has now concluded another bilateral Framework Agreement on cross-border teleworking. In addition to the existing Framework Agreement between Austria and Germany, which has been in effect since January 1, 2023, another teleworking agreement was signed with the Czech Republic at the end of January 2023. The framework agreement will come into force on March 1, 2023.\n\nWhat does the Framework Agreement regulate?\n\nEmployees who work for employers – “usually on a regular and recurrent basis” – in the employer’s country on the one hand and in the employee´s country of residence on the other hand continue to be insured in the employer’s country, provided that the extent of telework in the country of residence does not exceed 40%.\n\nWhich situations are (not) covered by the Framework Agreement?\n\nLikewise to the Framework Agreement between Austria and Germany, an application must be submitted in order for the Framework Agreement to be applicable. Furthermore, the Framework Agreement only applies to dependent employment for one (!) employer and not to self-employed activities. The Framework Agreement also does not apply to activities outside these two countries (Austria, Czech Republic). In case of doubt, an individual case assessment may be necessary.\n\nOverlap with other provisions\n\nThe Framework Agreement does not affect circumstances covered by the Covid- no impact approach, which in principle continues to apply until 30.6.2023 and means that pandemic-related changes in working patterns (e.g. home office activities) do not lead to a change in the social security responsibility to the state of residence. Also unaffected by the Framework Agreement are the Guidelines of the EU Administrative Commission on the interpretation of the provisions of Regulation (EC) 883/2004 with regard to telework.\n\nIn principle, however, the following applies: Without these bilateral Framework Agreements, telework (home office activity) in the country of residence to the extent of 25% or more would already lead to an affiliation with the social security system of the employee´s country of residence.\n\nIn addition to the Framework Agreement, which is also based on Article 16 (exemption agreement), but requires a differentiated application procedure, an ordinary exemption agreement according to Article 16 of Regulation (EC) 883/2004 can always be filed. Attention: In no case there is a legal claim and application is mandatory.\n\nFurther bilateral Framework Agreements are very likely to follow. Stay tuned!\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to our experts:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nThis publication has been prepared for general guidance on matters of interest only, and does not constitute professional advice.

Neben der bereits bestehenden und seit 1.1.2023 gültigen Rahmenvereinbarung zwischen Österreich und Deutschland, wurde Ende Jänner 2023 eine weitere Telearbeitsvereinbarung mit Tschechien unterzeichnet. Die Rahmenvereinbarung tritt mit 1.3.2023 in Kraft.\n\nWas regelt die Rahmenvereinbarung?\n\nArbeitnehmer:innen, die für Arbeitgeber – “üblicherweise regelmäßig wiederkehrend” – einerseits im Sitzstaat des Arbeitgebers und andererseits im Wohnstaat tätig sind, bleiben weiterhin im Arbeitgeberstaat versichert, sofern das Ausmaß der Telearbeit im Wohnstaat 40% nicht überschreitet.\n\nWelche Sachverhalte umfasst die Rahmenvereinbarung (nicht)?\n\nWie auch in der Rahmenvereinbarung zwischen Österreich und Deutschland geregelt, muss für die Anwendung der Rahmenvereinbarung jedenfalls ein Antrag gestellt werden. Außerdem gilt die Rahmenvereinbarung nur für abhängige Beschäftigungen für einen (!) Arbeitgeber und nicht für selbständige Tätigkeiten. Auch gilt die Rahmenvereinbarung nicht für Tätigkeiten außerhalb dieser beiden Staaten (Österreich, Tschechien). Im Zweifel kann eine Einzelfallbeurteilung notwendig sein.\n\nÜberschneidung mit anderen Bestimmungen\n\nVon der Rahmenvereinbarung unberührt bleiben Sachverhalte, die von der Covid-Sonderregel umfasst sind, welche grundsätzlich weiterhin bis 30.6.2023 anwendbar ist, und dazu führt, dass pandemiebedingte Änderungen des Arbeitsmusters (z.B. Home Office Tätigkeiten) zu keinem Wechsel der SV-Zuständigkeit in den Wohnstaat führt. Außerdem unberührt von der Rahmenvereinbarung bleiben die Leitlinien der EU-Verwaltungskommission zur Auslegung der Bestimmungen der VO (EG) 883/2004 in Bezug auf Telearbeit.\n\nGrundsätzlich gilt aber: Ohne diese bilateralen Rahmenvereinbarungen, bestünde bei Telearbeit.\n(Home Office-Tätigkeit) im Wohnstaat im Ausmaß von 25% und mehr bereits Sozialversicherungspflicht im Wohnstaat. Neben der Rahmenvereinbarung, welche auch auf Artikel 16 (Ausnahmevereinbarung) basiert, aber ein differenziertes Antragsverfahren erfordert, kann immer eine gewöhnliche Ausnahmevereinbarung nach Artikel 16 der VO (EG) 883/2004 gestellt werden. Achtung: In keinem Fall besteht ein Rechtsanspruch und es gilt Antragspflicht.\n\nWeitere bilaterale Rahmenvereinbarungen folgen sehr wahrscheinlich.

        "title": "Kenya | Employment Tax | Finance Bill 2024 highlights",
        "date": "May 23, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nKenya | Finance Bill 2024 highlights\n\nSummary\n\nThe Finance Bill, 2024 (“the Bill”) was tabled before the National assembly on 9th May 2024. The Bill proposes several amendments to the current Kenya tax legislation including The Income Tax Act, The Valued Added Tax Act, The Tax Procedures Act, The Excise Duty Act and The Miscellaneous Fees and Levies Act. The Bill primarily focuses on the expansion of the tax base with aiming to increasing revenue collection.\n\nThe proposed employment tax legislation amendments target to align employee reimbursements with the current economic realities such as increasing the per diem and non-cash benefits thresholds. Additionally, the Bill tries to address issues surrounding the newly introduced Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF) and highly contested Affordable Housing Levy.\n\nThis bulletin provides a high-level analysis to the employment tax proposal changes and their potential implications on employers and employees in Kenya. Should the Bill be passed into law in its current form, the proposals herein will take effect from 1 July 2024\n\nThe detail\n\nPer diem and prescribed non-cash benefits aggregate value adjustments\n\nPer diem\n\nCurrently the first KES 2,000 per day, paid to an employee working out of station to cater for subsistence, travelling, entertainment or other out of pocket expenses. This only relates to a period an employee spends outside the usual workplace while on official duties is deemed reimbursable and not subject to tax.\n\nThe Bill proposes to increase the tax-free threshold from KES 2,000 to a maximum of 5% of the employee’s monthly gross earnings. Accordingly, employers are now required to put in place a Per Diem policy to govern the payment and accounting of such expenses.\n\nNon-cash benefits\n\nSection 5 (b) of the Income Tax Act provides that the value of non-prescribed benefit, advantage, or facility of whatsoever nature whose aggregate value is greater than KES 36,000 per annum is subject to tax. The Bill seeks to increase this threshold to KES 48,000 per annum. This therefore means that any non-cash benefits conferred to employees in the course of their employment will be non-taxable up to KES 48,000 per annum (KES 4,000 per month).\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the above excludes any prescribed non-cash benefits whose taxability is specifically provided for in the Kenya tax legislation.\n\nMeals to employees\n\nThe Bill proposes to increase the non-taxable threshold for meals provided by employers to employees from the current KES 48,000 per annum to KES 60,0000 per annum.\n\nImplications of the revised thresholds: The above non-taxable amounts have remained unchanged for a prolonged period, despite significant fluctuations in the economy over the years. These proposals are highly welcome as they try to cushion employees from the evolving harsh economic landscape, particularly the rising inflation. Moreover, it will also incentivize employers to provide these benefits to their employees.\n\nRetirement benefits and pension contributions\n\nIncreased threshold for allowable pension contributions\n\nSection 16 (22)(a) of the Income Tax Act currently provides for tax deductible benefit amount of up to KES 240,000 per annum (KES 20,000 per month) against the taxable income in respect an employee’s pension contributions to a registered pension scheme. The Bill proposes to increase the tax-deductible amount to KES 360,000 per annum (KES 30,000 per month)\n\nTax exemption for pension benefits.\n\nCurrently, the Income Tax Act provides for an exemption from tax the monthly or lumpsum pension benefits payout to an individual who has attained the age of 65 years and over (senior citizen). The Bill seeks to extend the exemption from tax, the pension benefits payments to individuals who retire upon the attainment of the retirement age as may be determined and in accordance with the fund’s rules and regulations. The Bill further proposes a tax exemption of pension benefit payments to individuals who retire before attaining the retirement age due to ill health or who withdraw from the fund after twenty years from the date of registration as members of the fund.\n\nImplications of the proposed retirement benefit changes: Increasing the threshold for allowable deductions on pension contributions as well as extending the pension benefits tax exemption threshold aims to incentivize participation in registered pension schemes by both employers and employees, thereby fostering a culture of saving. If enacted, this proposal would likely result in a higher number of employers and employees making pension contributions, supplementing the standard mandatory contributions to the National Social Security Fund\n\nSocial Health Insurance, Housing Levy and Post retirement Medical Fund\n\nDeductibility of Social Health Insurance contributions\n\nThe Bill proposes a tax deductible of contributions made to the recently introduced Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF) against the monthly taxable income. The Bill also proposes to delete the tax relief granted under the current NHIF Act. For clarity, the SHIF will take effect from 1st July 2024 and replace the current National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF).\n\nScrapping of the post-retirement medical relief\n\nThe Income Tax Act currently provides for a 15% tax relief on contributions made to a post-retirement medical fund of up to KES 60,000 per annum. The Bill proposes to delete the 15% tax relief against such contributions and introduces a tax-deductible amount of up to KES 120,000 per annum (10,000 per month) of the post- retirement medical fund contributions against the taxable income.\n\nScrapping of Affordable Housing relief.\n\nSection 30A of the Income Tax Act provides for 15% tax relief but capped to a maximum of KES 108,000 per annum on affordable housing to qualifying resident individuals. The bill proposes to repeal this section and make the Affordable Housing Levy (AHL) contributions an allowable deduction against the individual’s taxable income.\n\nImplications of the proposed changes: The deductibility of the contributions mentioned above will effectively reduce the tax base for employees making these contributions. This will consequently reduce the net tax payable by individuals who are currently facing the strain of heightened taxes and high cost of living in the country. While these measures are greatly welcome, it is currently a “wait and see” situation for the by-product of the Bill after National Assembly’s debate on whether it will improve contributions to post-retirement medical funds and potentially improve the citizens’ perceptions around the contentious AHL and SHIF contributions.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAndrew Ondieki\nDirector\n\nMercy Migwi\nSenior Associate\n\nRuth Mayenga\nAssociate\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "December 11, 2023",
        "content": "11 December 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nThe much anticipated final Migration Strategy has today been unveiled by the Minister for Home Affairs, including details of the new 4-year Skilled in Demand visa which will replace the Temporary Skilled Shortage visa program.\n\nThe Detail\n\nIn response to the  Review of the Migration System to the Government report, the Minister for Home Affairs has today released the final Migration Strategy, an ambitious roadmap to structural reform of Australia’s migration system with eight key actions, including a new approach to migration planning with the goal to reduce migration numbers back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nNew tiered risk approach for temporary skilled migration which promotes worker mobility\n\nAdopting the Review Panel’s recommendation of a tiered risk approach for temporary skilled migration, the new 4 year Skills in Demand visa will be comprised of three eligibility pathways:\n\nSpecialist Skills pathway for highly paid applicants in any occupation earning at least $135,000 per annum. As this pathway is intended to attract highly skilled workers (the Migration Strategy provides the example of workers in the technology or green energy sectors), trades workers, machinery operators and drivers, and labourers will be excluded. Streamlined and expedited 7 day median visa processing will apply to this pathway;\n\nCore Skills pathway for workers in skill shortage areas (based on a simpler and regularly updated Core Skills Occupation list) paid between $70,001 to $135,000 per annum. A median processing service standard of 21 days will apply;\n\nEssential skills pathway for lower paid workers in sector specific roles paid less than $70,000 per annum. This will be a more regulated pathway and will be developed in consultation with state and territory governments, unions, and businesses.\n\nA pathway to permanent residence will be guaranteed for Skills in Demand visa holders with the ability to count periods of employment with any approved employer towards permanent residence.\n\nOther key features of the Skills in Demand visa\n\nThe Government will index the new Core Skills and Specialist Skills Thresholds in line with annual movements in Average Weekly Ordinary Time Earnings.\n\nFormal role for Jobs and Skills Australia to define skills needs.\n\nStreamlined Labour Market Testing (LMT) requirements – as noted in our recent client alert, the requirement to advertise on the Workforce Australia website has now been removed from the current LMT requirements. Building on this, the advertising validity period will be increased from 4 months to 6 months, with the commitment to consider moving away from employer conducted LMT as Jobs and Skills Australia’s role further matures.\n\nNew public online register of employers who sponsor overseas workers, including number of workers sponsored and their occupations\n\nAll skilled visas will be mobile between employers to help tackle worker exploitation. Skills in Demand visa holders will also have a 180 day period to find another sponsor.\n\nUpfront Visa Application Charges and fees may be replaced by trailing charges and fees (eg paid by employers on a monthly or quarterly basis)\n\nEnhanced compliance and integrity units to combat worker exploitation.\n\nOpening up the Accredited Sponsorship program to start ups that have received venture capital funding from a registered venture capital fund.\n\nOther proposed reforms\n\nOther proposed reforms in the Migration Strategy include:\n\nReshaping permanent skilled migration – a commitment to consider a reformed points test for skilled migration and a new Talent and Innovation visa to attract entrepreneurs to drive growth in sectors of national importance.\n\nA package of stronger integrity measures for international students and graduates, including increasing English language requirements, greater scrutiny of high-risk student visa applications, restrictions on onshore visa renewals to combat ‘permanent temporariness’ and strengthened and simplified Temporary Graduate visa settings.\n\nA suite of legislation, powers and penalties to address worker exploitation and restore integrity to the migration system.\n\nRejigging regional visas and the Working Holiday Maker program to support regional Australia – commitments include a new direction to ensure regional visas are afforded the highest priority in visa processing.\n\nStrengthening Indo-Pacific ties through a direct pathway for Citizenship for New Zealand citizens and increased mobility programs with Pacific Island and Southeast Asian countries.\n\nImproving experience for employers and migrants by simplifying the migration system through streamlining visa settings and reducing the number of visa classes.\n\nWhere to from here?\n\nAs expected, a phased approach to the reforms will be undertaken. With the release of the final Migration Strategy, the Minister has also unveiled a Migration Strategy Action Plan which provides an implementation and consultation timeline for areas of future reform.  As part of the next phase of consultation, early in 2024 the Government will publish discussion papers on permanent skilled migration and regional migration, including the evaluation of the Working Holiday Maker program.\n\nAttached is a summary of the migration reforms for your use.\n\nVialto Partners is closely monitoring developments and will provide updates as further information is released.

        "date": "August 16, 2023",
        "content": "August 2, 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact High\n\nSummary\n\nThe states of Maine and Minnesota have both implemented paid family leave programs that will impose new responsibilities on employers in these states over the next few years.\nIn Maine, contributions to the Paid Family Leave fund are set to begin on January 1, 2025, with benefits to eligible Maine employees scheduled to begin on May 1, 2026.\nIn Minnesota, employers will be required to submit premium payments starting January 1, 2026, with benefits available to eligible Minnesota employees beginning on January 1, 2026. Reporting requirements for Minnesota employers will begin in July of 2024, and the requirement to notify employees of the Paid Family and Medical Leave program will start in late-2025. Specific dates for such reporting and notification requirements are not yet available.\n\nOverview\n\nMaine – Paid Family and Medical Leave Program (PFML):\n\nPFML is a program funded by employee and employer contributions (where applicable), up to the social security wage base in effect for the year. Contributions to the PFML program are set to begin on January 1, 2025. The Maine Department of Labor will begin the rulemaking process in January of 2024, with the initial rules necessary for implementation of the PFML program to be adopted by the Maine Department of Labor by January 1, 2025.\n\nHighlights:\n\nMinnesota- Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML):\n\nPFML in Minnesota is paid for by employers and employees at 0.7% of an employee’s taxable wages, which is the social security wage base in effect for the year. Employers may charge a maximum of half of the premium (0.35%) to their employees through a wage deduction. Premium rates may be adjusted annually, not to exceed 1.2 percent of each employee’s gross wages. Premium payments and benefits are set to begin January 1, 2026.\n\nHighlights:\n\n➢ Quarterly wage detail reports will be required by most Minnesota employers starting July 1, 2025. This report will detail the quarterly wages received and hours worked for each employee.\n➢ Premiums will be due on a quarterly basis, on or before the last day of the month following the end of the calendar quarter.\n➢ The PMFL program will have its own employer account system whether the employer will submit wage detail reports and make premium payments.\n➢ Employers with less than 30 employees may exclude a portion of the wages upon which the quarterly employer premium is required, thereby reducing the amount of employer premiums due. The reduction in premiums is for the sole benefit of the employer and does not relieve the employer from deducting the employee portion of the premium.\n➢ Employers may apply for approval to meet its obligations under the PFML program through a private plan.\n➢ Covered employees are eligible to take up to 12 weeks of medical leave or family leave for a single qualifying event, or up to 20 weeks of combined medical and family leave if the employee has more than one qualifying event in the same year.\n\nHow we can help\n\nVialto can assist you in complying with your responsibilities related to state paid leave programs, including determining which employees are covered under the program, assisting with any required registrations, calculating employee and employer contribution amounts, drafting employee communications, and assisting with wage reporting.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n• Tina Schrob, Partner | cristina.g.schrob@vialto.com\n• Greg Fetter, Partner | gregory.fetter@vialto.com\n• Ligeia Donis, Partner | ligeia.m.donis@vialto.com\n• Priya Schwartzburt, Director | priya.c.schwartzburt@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

The Tax Office denied the specified daily and overnight allowances, holding that the trips didn’t qualify as travel under the Income Tax Act because the locations visited were the company’s permanent establishments. The Taxpayer argued that the trips qualified as travel under the Income Tax Act, because the locations were not the Taxpayer’s place of work, and that they only traveled to these locations for meetings at long intervals when necessary. On appeal, the Federal Finance Court denied the Taxpayer’s argument, finding that:\n\nWhat this means for employers\n\nEmployers should ensure compliance with tax regulations when reimbursing employees for travel-related expenses, particularly regarding daily and overnight allowances. Even though the conditions for tax-free travel expenses are very restrictive in Austria, we recommend employers reviewing their business trips to maximize any tax-saving potential.

        "title": "Japan | Transition to My Number Card for health insurance — key changes and guidance",
        "date": "November 29, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nFrom December 2, 2024, the Japanese government will stop issuing traditional health insurance cards, transitioning entirely to the use of the My Number Card as a health insurance card. This multi-purpose card, referred to as the My Number Health Insurance Card, integrates health insurance and various government service functionalities.\n\nIntroduced in 2016, the My Number Card serves as official identification card for identity verification purpose and grants access to a broad range of government services in Japan. It is issued to all Japanese nationals and medium- to long-term foreign residents staying in Japan for over three months. This integration of health insurance into the My Number Card further enhances its importance. This alert highlights the key procedures and considerations for transitioning to the My Number card, which will be essential for managing foreign employees in Japan.\n\nThe detail\n\n1) Transition to the My Number Health Insurance Card (My Na Hokensho): Key Timelines and Procedures\n\nFrom December 2, 2024, conventional health insurance cards will no longer be issued. However existing health insurance cards will remain valid until their expiry date, but no later than December 1, 2025.\n\nIndividuals who have not obtained a My Number Card or have not registered to use the My Number Health Insurance Card will be issued an Eligibility Confirmation Certificate from their medical insurer. This certificate can be presented at medical institutions to access insured medical care. However, the Japanese government recommends transitioning to the My Number Health Insurance Card to simplify future procedures.\n\nFor foreign nationals, the transition process depends on the individual’s timing of arrival in Japan and the type of medical insurance they are enrolled in, as outlined below.\n\n\n\n*Note: If there is a change in insurance eligibility, such as a job change before December 2, 2025, individuals must transition to either the My Number Health Insurance Card or the Eligibility Confirmation Certificate.\n\nEmployers are advised to guide employees through the application and registration processes to ensure compliance with these updated requirements.\n\n2) My Number Card Validity and Renewal Requirements for Foreign Residents\n\nThe validity period of a foreign resident’s My Number Card depends on their visa type. Updates to a visa’s expiry date, such as after a visa extension, are not automatically reflected on the My Number Card. Therefore, once a visa extension or new period of stay is granted, foreign residents must visit their local municipal office before the card expires to update its validity. If this step is not completed, the card will expire (and will impact usage, including health insurance, if registered for health insurance use), requiring the resident to reapply for a new card.\n\n\n\n・For individuals under 18 years: Until the cardholder’s 5th birthday following card issuance\n\n3) Special Measures for My Number Card Validity During Residency Renewal\n\nIf a residence extension or status change application is under review, a special measure under the Immigration Control Act allows foreign residents to remain in Japan under their current status until the review is completed or up to two months from the visa’s expiration date, whichever is sooner.\n\nHowever, this grace period does not apply automatically to the My Number Card. To continue using the card, residents must complete a “Validity Extension Procedure” at their local city or ward office before their visa expires. This procedure extends the My Number Card’s validity for up to two months.\n\nIf the extension procedure is not completed, the card will become invalid, requiring reissuance (with associated fees). This step is essential for maintaining uninterrupted access to services linked to the My Number Card.\n\n4) Updates to Social Insurance Procedures\n\nFrom December 2, 2024, a new section will be added to the Notification of Acquisition of Insured Status and Dependent Change Notification forms submitted by the employers to social insurance offices and pension offices.\n\nThe forms will include a section titled “Need to issue an Eligibility Confirmation Certificate or not”. If the certificate is required, employers must check the “Issuance Necessary” box on the form. Based on this information, the Eligibility Confirmation Certificate will be issued.\n\nThis certificate is particularly important for foreign employees and their dependents who do not have a My Number Card upon entering Japan and cannot use the My Number Card, as it serves as proof of health insurance coverage and ensures access to insured medical treatment.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe My Number Card is becoming essential for health insurance in Japan as traditional health insurance cards will be phased out by December 2, 2024, with existing cards valid only until Dec 1, 2025. While obtaining the card itself is not legally mandatory, it is strongly encouraged to avoid inconvenience.\n\nMedium- to long-term residents must manage My Number Card renewals separately from Residence Cards renewals, requesting temporary extensions if necessary.\n\nEmployers are expected to guide employees in adapting to the changes, including arranging Eligibility Confirmation Certificate for new foreign residents to ensure access to insured healthcare before receiving their My Number Cards.\n\nHow we can help\n\nThe Japanese government is promoting the widespread use of the My Number Card, including new integrations:\n\nThe Vialto Partners Japan Team offers comprehensive support services for immigration, social insurance, and tax matters. If you have any questions about the new system or require assistance with procedures for foreign nationals, please feel free to reach out to the Japan team at Vialto Partners.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nNoriyuki Tominaga\nPartner\n\nJia Ee\nDirector\n\nRyo Uehara\nDirector\n\nWakana Tachikawa\nSenior Manager\n\nAtsuko Yamamoto\nManager\n\nSaeko Ichimi\nSenior Associate\n\nZoila Mundell\nAssociate\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nイミグレーション\n\n概要\n\n日本政府は2024年12月2日以降、従来の健康保険証の新規発行を停止し、マイナンバーカードを健康保険証として利用する「マイナ保険証」への全面的な移行を推進します。マイナンバーカードは日本に3か月を超えて在留する外国籍の中長期在留者も発行対象としており、今回の健康保険証との統合により、今後の外国籍社員の管理における重要性がさらに高まることが予想されます。本アラートでは、今後の外国籍社員の在留管理において必要となるマイナンバーカード関連の手続き及び留意点を整理します。\n\n詳細\n\n1) 外国籍者のマイナ保険証への移行プロセス\n\n従来の健康保険証の新規発行は2024年12月2日以降停止されますが、既に発行済みの現行の健康保険証は有効期限内であれば最長で2025年12月1日まで使用可能です。日本政府はマイナ保険証への移行を推奨していますが、マイナンバーカードを取得していない方やマイナ保険証の利用登録を行っていない方には、加入している医療保険者から「資格確認証」が交付され、この「資格確認証」を医療機関で提示することで従来通り保険診療を受けることも可能です。下記は、入国時期及び加入中の医療保険に応じた今後のマイナ保険証への移行プロセスです。\n\n2) マイナカード有効期限\n\n外国籍者のマイナンバーカードの有効期限は在留資格に応じて異なります。在留期間の更新許可等により在留期間が変更された場合であっても、その情報 はマイナンバーカードには自動的に反映されません。そのため、在留カードの更新手続きを行った際には、新しい在留カードの受領後、マイナンバーカードの期限が到来するまでに居住地の市区町村窓口でマイナンバーカードの有効期間の延長手続きを行う必要があります。この手続きを行わない場合、マイナンバーカード（保険証利用登録を行っている場合は、マイナ保険証）が失効し、再申請が必要となります。\n\n3) 在留期間更新手続き中の注意点\n\n在留期間更新許可申請や在留資格変更許可申請の審査期間中に在留期限が到来した場合、入管法に基づく特例期間により、審査結果が出るまで、もしくは在留期間の満了の日から2か月が経過する日のいずれか早い時点まで、現行の在留資格で引き続き在留することが可能です。\n\nただし、マイナンバーカードにはこの特例期間が自動的に適用されないため、引き続き使用するには市区町村役場で「有効期間の延長手続き」（最長2か月）を在留期限が到来する前までに行う必要があります。この手続きを行わない場合、マイナンバーカードは失効し、カードの再申請（有料）が必要となりますのでご留意ください。\n\n4) 社会保険手続き上の留意点\n\n2024年12月2日以降、企業が社会保険事務所及び年金事務所に提出を行う「被保険者資格取得届」および「被扶養者（異動）届」には新たに「資格確認書発行要否」欄が設けられます。新たに被保険者や被扶養者になる方が資格確認書を必要とする場合は、届書の「□発行が必要」にチェックを入れて申告することとなります。この届出内容に基づき、資格確認書が発行されることとなります。\n特に、日本入国時点においてはマイナンバーカードを保有しておらず、またマイナンバーカードを健康保険証として利用できない外国籍従業員やその扶養家族については、この資格確認書が健康保険の被保険者であることを証明する重要な書類となります。\n\nWhat this means\n\n2024年12月2日より従来の健康保険証の新規発行が廃止され、マイナンバーカードは日本の健康保険制度において中心的な役割を担うことになります。カードの取得は法律上の義務ではありませんが、政府はその取得を強く推奨しています。また、中長期在留者の場合、在留カードの更新とは別に、マイナンバーカードの更新が必要になる点にも留意が必要です。さらに、外国人従業員を雇用する事業主には、新制度への対応として新規入国者がマイナンバーカードの受け取り前でも医療保険が利用できるよう資格確認証を手配することや、従業員に対して新制度に関する情報提供や更新手続きのサポートを行う等の支援を提供することが求められます。\n\nHow we can help\n\n現在、日本政府はマイナンバーカードの普及と活用の拡大を推進しています。行政手続きでは、2025年3月より運転免許証との一体化が実施される予定です。また、税務手続においては、国税庁がE-Taxを通じた納税手続の際に、納税者が本人確認書類の添付やパスワードの管理を省略できる新しい仕組みを導入しており、マイナポータルとの連携を通じた税務手続きの簡素化が実施されております。\n\nVialto Partners日本チームでは、イミグレーション、社会保険、税務に関する総合的なサポートを提供しております。新制度についてのご質問や外国籍者の手続きに関するご相談がございましたら、ぜひVialto Partners日本チームまでご連絡ください。\n\nお問い合わせ\n\nより詳しい情報は、Vialtoパートナーズの担当者までお問い合わせください:\n\n冨永 紀之\nPartner\n\nJia Ee\nDirector\n\n上原 龍\nDirector\n\n立川 若納\nSenior Manager\n\n山本 厚子\nManager\n\n一見さえこ\nSenior Associate\n\nZoila Mundell\nAssociate\n\nVialtoパートナーズの詳細はこちらをご覧ください\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "For the estimated 1 million Ukrainians living in Poland, over 755 thousand actively employed, understanding the complex Polish tax system is a significant challenge.As the April 30th deadline for filing individual tax returns looms, it’s crucial to navigate the ever-evolving tax laws, characterized by frequent updates and varied interpretations by authorities. This is particularly true for foreigners, including Ukrainians, who often find Poland’s tax requirements daunting. Grasping these regulations can lead to considerable savings and avert potential legal complications.\n\nA large segment of the Ukrainian workforce in Poland is aged between 30 to 39. Ukrainians have also shown strong entrepreneurial drive, launching around 50,000 businesses. Additionally, the community includes a significant number of women with children, with over 300,000 Ukrainian children attending Polish schools.\n\nTax reconciliation poses specific challenges for Ukrainian citizens, such as remote work arrangements and the establishment of a “permanent establishment” status for entrepreneurs. Issues around tax residency become even more complex against the backdrop of ongoing conflicts.\n\nLeveraging its deep expertise in individual tax matters, Vialto Partners Poland collaborated with the Polish-Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce to present two essential, complimentary tax guides for Ukrainian expats – one tailored for employees and the other for entrepreneurs.\n\nThe guides (available below) are indispensable handbooks for Ukrainians working or conducting business in Poland, offering clarity on navigating the Polish tax system effectively.\n\nThe Polish tax environment is intricate, catering to a wide array of individuals including residents, non-residents, employees, and entrepreneurs. For Ukrainian expatriates, mastering this system is critical for compliance and proper application of tax benefits. The fiscal year in Poland aligns with the calendar year, incorporating taxes like income tax, corporate tax, VAT, and more. Tax residency hinges on various factors, including the length of stay and the center of personal or economic interests.\n\nThe guides offer practical examples and case studies to simplify the tax filing process, addressing a wide range of tax considerations for Ukrainian employees and entrepreneurs in Poland. Key areas covered include:\n\nUkrainian employees in Poland are subject to a progressive tax rate on their income, necessitating an understanding of the conversion from gross to net salary, which includes mandatory social security and health contributions. These contributions, though mandatory, provide access to Poland’s healthcare and social security benefits. Sample calculations in the guide illuminate the tax implications across various income levels for 2023.\n\nSample Tax Settlement Calculations for Income from Employment for 2023:\n\nEmployees must register for a PESEL number and entrepreneurs need to obtain a NIP number as well as meet the April 30th filing deadline for the previous year’s earnings. The guides detail the required forms, documents, and registration procedures, emphasizing timely compliance to avoid penalties.\n\nImportant for both groups, the guides delve into opportunities for tax deductions and credits, ranging from work-related expenses for employees to deductions for social security contributions and business expenses for entrepreneurs. To mitigate double taxation, the guides clarify how to claim relief or exempt income taxed in Ukraine from taxation in Poland .\n\nThe guides also spotlight recent changes in tax laws or procedures for 2023, ensuring readers are up-to-date. This includes modifications in tax rates, new deductions or credits, and changes in filing processes or deadlines.\n\nUsing these guides can lead to savings, support efforts to achieve compliance, and help avoid legal complications. We invite you to download the comprehensive tax guides below, selecting the appropriate guide and language for your needs.\n\nTax settlement in Poland for 2023 – Guide for Ukrainian Employees\n\nTax settlement in Poland for 2023 – Guide for Ukrainian Entrepreneurs\n\nThese guides strive to equip Ukrainian expatriates with the insights and tools to effectively manage the Polish tax system.

        "title": "Germany I Employment Tax | Taxation of sign-on bonus according to the circular of the Federal Ministry of Finance dated December 12, 2023",
        "date": "April 23, 2024",
        "content": "In its circular on the tax treatment of employment income under double taxation agreements (DTAs), the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) has specified the taxation of signing bonuses and specified on how such one-time payments should be allocated in the case of cross-border employment.\n\nA signing bonus constitutes remuneration from employment in accordance with Section 19 German income tax act (EStG). In the case of cross-border activities, Art. 15 OECD-Model Tax Convention assigns the right of taxation to the country of residence or activity. The BMF now specifies in the circular dated December 12, 2023 how the allocation is to be made.\n\nFirst of all, the contractual basis of the one-time payment must be examined. If the employment contract or an ancillary agreement stipulates that the sign-on bonus does not have to be repaid in the event of early termination of the employment agreements, the employee’s country of residence has the right of taxation. If, on the other hand, a repayment obligation is contractually stipulated or if it is a fixed-term contract from the outset, which can neither be terminated nor canceled prematurely, the right of taxation does not belong to the country of residence but to the country where the employment is physically performed provided that this country can also tax the regular employment income. The sign-on bonus is therefore linked to a specific future activity. The vesting period for the one-time payment is the contract term or the date on which the payment becomes vested.\n\nSign-on Bonuses are generally paid out at the beginning of the contract term and a breakdown according to actual working days can initially only be made as part of an appropriate estimate. As soon as the vesting period has expired, the estimate made must be reviewed and corrected in the event of deviations. The tax must therefore be provisionally assessed until the end of the vesting period in accordance with Section 165 German fiscal code.\n\nDas Bundesministerium der Finanzen (BMF) hat mit dem Schreiben zur steuerlichen Behandlung des Arbeitslohns nach Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen (DBA) die Besteuerung von Antrittsgeldern (Signing Bonus) konkretisiert und Stellung genommen, wie derartige Einmalzahlungen bei grenzüberschreitender Tätigkeit aufzuteilen sind.\n\nEin Antrittsgeld (Signing Bonus) stellt eine Vergütung aus nichtselbständiger Tätigkeit nach § 19 EStG dar. Bei grenzüberscheitender Tätigkeit weist Art. 15 OECD-Musterabkommen das Besteuerungsrecht dem Ansässigkeits- bzw. Tätigkeitsstaat zu. Wie die Aufteilung zu erfolgen hat, konkretisiert das BMF nun in dem überarbeiteten Schreiben vom 12. Dezember 2023.\n\nZunächst ist die vertragliche Grundlage der Einmalzahlung zu prüfen. Wird im Arbeitsvertrag oder in einer Nebenabrede festgelegt, dass das Antrittsgeld bei vorzeitigen Ausscheiden aus dem Arbeitsverhältnis nicht zurückgezahlt werden muss, so steht dem Ansässigkeitsstaat des Mitarbeiters das Besteuerungsrecht zu. Wird hingegen eine Rückzahlungsverpflichlichtung vertraglich festgelegt oder handelt es sich im Vornherein um einen zeitlich befristeten Vertrag, der weder vorzeitig aufgelöst noch gekündigt werden kann, so steht nicht dem Ansässigkeitsstaat sondern dem Tätigkeitsstaat das Besteuerungsrecht zu vorausgesetzt, dass dieser Staat auch das reguläre Arbeitseinkommen besteuern darf. Die Auszahlung des Antrittsgeldes ist somit an eine konkrete  zukünftige Tätigkeit geknüpft. Erdienungszeitraum für die Einmalzahlung ist die Vertragslaufzeit bzw. der Eintritt der Unverfallbarkeit der Zahlung.\n\nAntrittsgelder werden i.d.R. zu Beginn der Vertragslaufzeit ausbezahlt und eine Aufteilung nach tatsächlichen Arbeitstagen kann zunächst nur im Rahmen einer sachgerechten Schätzung vorgenommen werden. Sobald der Erdienungszeitraum abgelaufen ist, ist die vorgenommene Schätzung zu überprüfen und bei Abweichungen zu korrigieren. Die Steuer ist daher bis zum Ablauf des Erdienungszeitraums nach § 165 Abgabenordnung vorläufig festzusetzen.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMathias Schmitt \nPartner\n\nDamaris Besenreuther\nSenior Manager\n\nSina Kunzweiler\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit: www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

Indeed, the proposed measures were (on some points) rather drastic and surrounded by many pragmatics but also fundamental questions.\n\nNotwithstanding the intention of the Belgian Prime Minister to proceed with the first chapter of the tax reform prior to the Belgian National Day (21 July 2023), no draft text of law was introduced before Parliament.\n\nMoreover, despite various further meetings within the government’s core cabinet in July 2023, no agreement was reached on the actual tax reform measures.\n\nAs the saying goes: “the water was too deep” …\n\nTakeaways\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nPhilip Maertens\nPartner\n\nBart Elias\nPartner\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here:www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

However, earlier this year, the Brazilian government had announced that individuals holding any of those 3 nationalities would have the Visitor Visa requirement reinstated; as a result, by 1st October 2023, they would need to obtain an Electronic Visa at any nearest Brazilian Consulate before being authorized to enter the Brazilian territory.\n\nOn August 30th, 2023, the Brazilian government cancelled the earlier announcement and, therefore, the Visitor Visa reinstatement is, for the moment, postponed until January 10th, 2024.\n\nThe current Visitor Visa waiver is applicable for those on business and/or pleasure trips to Brazil.  In this sense, for other type of travelers, it should be carefully analyzed in order to determine if an specific visa or work permit is required before entering Brazil.\n\nContact us\n\nFlavia Fernandes – Immigration, Employment, Social Security and Tax Partner (flavia.fernandes@vialto.com)\n\nAndré Sousa – Manager (andre.nsousa@vialto.com)\n\nAntonieta Mosquera – Senior Manager (antonieta.mosquera@vialto.com)\n\nPatrícia Kater – Senior Manager (patricia.kater@vialto.com)\n\nRenata Araújo – Senior Manager (renata.araujo@vialto.com)",

        "title": "United States | Tax | New Jersey Establishes a “Convenience of the Employer” Rule and Allows Tax Credit for Remote Workers",
        "date": "August 17, 2023",
        "content": "August 2, 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact : High\n\nSummary\n\nOn July 21, 2023, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed into law Assembly Bill 4694 establishing New Jersey’s “convenience of the employer” rule and providing various tax credits related to remote work. Under New Jersey’s convenience of the employer rule, non-resident employees assigned to a New Jersey work location must source days spent working remotely (i.e., working from home) outside New Jersey for the employee’s own convenience if the employee is a resident of a state that imposes a convenience of the employer rule on New Jersey residents. In addition, Assembly Bill 4694 provides qualified taxpayers with a credit against New Jersey gross income tax otherwise due of $2,000 in a taxable year; a qualified taxpayer is defined as a “taxpayer who is a New Jersey resident and whose employer has assigned that individual a work location outside of the State, who seeks from the employer and accepts a permanent reassignment of work location to a New Jersey location during the taxable year. Additional programs included in the bill provide tax incentives to certain taxpayers and businesses.\n\nOverview\n\nConvenience of the Employer Rule:\n\nAssembly Bill 4694 establishes a convenience of the employer test for residents of states that impose a similar test on New Jersey residents. As an example, under New York’s convenience of the employer rule a New Jersey resident assigned to a New York work location must source days spent working from home in New Jersey for the employee’s own convenience to New York; under New Jersey’s convenience of the employer rule New York residents assigned to a New Jersey work location must now source days spent working from home in New York for their own convenience to New Jersey. New Jersey will not apply its convenience of the employer rule to residents of states that do not impose a convenience of the employer rule on New Jersey residents, nor will the rule have any impact on New Jersey’s withholding reciprocity agreement with Pennsylvania (i.e., Pennsylvania residents that qualify for exemption from New Jersey gross income tax under the reciprocal agreement will remain exempt as long as they still qualify under the reciprocal agreement). New Jersey’s new convenience of the employer rule will apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. More information from the New Jersey Division of Taxation on how to retroactively apply this new requirement is expected to be released in the coming months.\n\nStates that currently impose a convenience of the employer test include Connecticut, Delaware, Nebraska, New York, and Pennsylvania.\n\nTax Credits related to Remote Work:\n\nAssembly Bill 4694 establishes a non-refundable gross income tax credit of $2,000 for the taxable year per qualified taxpayer, which is defined in pertinent part as a taxpayer assigned to a work location outside of the State who requests and accepts a reassignment from their employer to a New Jersey work location. Per the bill, this section is expected to take effect immediately.\n\nAn additional tax credit applicable for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020, but before January 1, 2024 allows remote workers who are subject to the convenience of the employer rule in other states to claim a refundable gross income tax credit against their New Jersey gross income tax liability. A New Jersey resident taxpayer is eligible for this credit if the following are present: (1) the taxpayer paid income or wage tax to another jurisdiction; (2) the taxpayer applied for and was denied a refund from such jurisdiction on income derived from services rendered while the New Jersey resident taxpayer was within New Jersey; and (3) the taxpayer filed an appeal protesting the jurisdiction’s denial of refund and obtained a final judgment from the jurisdiction’s tax court which grants the taxpayer an income tax refund on the grounds that the income was derived from services rendered while the resident taxpayer was within New Jersey. This credit equals 50% of the taxes owed to New Jersey due to the readjustment of New Jersey’s credit for taxes paid to another state.\n\nFinally, the bill establishes a pilot program to be administered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority which will provide grants to businesses who reassign their New Jersey resident employees from work locations outside of the state to New Jersey locations. A business is eligible for a grant under the pilot program if the business has 25 or more full time employees and is principally located in another state. All grant applications must be filed on or before July 1, 2028.\n\nHow we can help\n\nVialto can assist you in complying with your responsibilities related to the New Jersey convenience of the employer rule, including reviewing remote employees’ state resident and work location to ensure accurate payroll tax set up and advising on specific tax withholding requirements.\n\nPlease reach out directly to your Vialto contact or one of the individuals listed below to discuss.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n• Tina Schrob, Partner | cristina.g.schrob@vialto.com\n• Greg Fetter, Partner | gregory.fetter@vialto.com\n• Ligeia Donis, Partner | ligeia.m.donis@vialto.com\n• Priya Schwartzburt, Director | priya.c.schwartzburt@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

In this update, you will find further background on the amendments, as well as the expected impact thereof.\n\nPlease note: The Dutch Senate Eerste Kamer) has yet to vote on (a.o.) the amendments of the 30% ruling. This vote is scheduled for 19 December. If the Dutch Senate votes in favour, the proposed changes will become effective as of 1 January 2024 and 1 January 2025.\n\nAmendment 1 Adjustment of maximum tax-free allowance\nImpact of the amendment:30% ruling to become a 30/20/10% ruling\nProposed implementation date: 1 January 2024 (subject to transitional law)\n\nThe amendment of the 30% ruling comes down to a further limitation of the benefit of the 30% ruling. While currently the maximum tax free percentage of the Dutch taxable wage that can be provided tax free is 30% (up to the ‘cap’ that will apply as of 2024 for the first cases, reference is made to our earlier update), this will be lowered during the duration of the 30% ruling. The first 20 months, the tax free percentage will remain 30%. For the second 20 months, this will be maximally 20%. In the last 20 months, the maximum tax free percentage will be 10%. Consequently, the maximum duration of the 30% ruling will remain five years.\n\nTransitional law\nIn the amendment, transitional law is included for individuals for whom the 30% ruling is applied in the last wage tax period of 2023 (usually December 2023 . For these individuals, the maximum tax free percentage remains 30% of the Dutch taxable wage during the period the 30% ruling has been granted by the Dutch tax authorities.\n\nGood to note in this regard is that the so-called ‘salary cap’ of the 30% ruling will still start to apply for certain employees as of 1 January 2024. For those employees, the maximum basis for the 30% ruling will be capped at an income level of EUR 233,000 for 2024, reference is made to our earlier update). This applies in particular for employees who started working in the Netherlands in 2023, as they do not qualify for the – separate – transitional rules in relation to the salary cap. The transitional rules for the salary cap only apply in case the 30% ruling was applied in the last wage tax period of 2022 (usually December 2022 .\n\nAmendment 2 Abolishment partial non-resident taxpayer regime\nImpact of the amendment: No exemption from Box 2 and Box 3 taxation for 30% ruling holders\nProposed implementation date: 1 January 2025 (subject to transitional law)\n\nImpact of the amendment\nIn addition to the amendment above, another amendment was passed by the House of Representatives. This amendment concerns the abolishment of the so-called partial non-resident taxpayer regime, under which holders of the 30% ruling are effectively exempt from Box 2 and Box\n\n3 taxation (limited exceptions apply). The proposed implementation date of this amendment is 1 January 2025. The abolishment means that holders of the 30% ruling will no longer (almost completely) be exempt from paying taxes in Box 2 (substantial shareholding) and Box 3 (savings and investments) but instead become taxable in the Netherlands over their worldwide income (if they can be regarded as a Dutch tax resident).\n\nTransitional law\nIn the amendment, transitional law is included for individuals for whom the 30% ruling is applied in the last wage tax period of 2023 (usually December 2023 . For these individuals, the abolishment of the partial non-resident taxpayer regime will apply as of 1 January 2027, instead of 1 January 2025.\n\nPoint of attention in relation to transitional law (amendment 1 and 2)\n\nEntitlement to transitional law\nWhile there is no written guidance from the authorities at this stage, there is a risk that the authorities will require that the 30% ruling is applied in the first run of the December 2023 payroll (to be eligible for the transitional rules). In other words, that a retroactive correction of the December 2023 payroll would not suffice if this is processed after 31/12/2023 (e.g. if the 30% ruling is applied retroactively for 2023 through a so-called 13th run in 2024 .\n\nSummary of transitional law for the 30% ruling\n\nWe note that, as a result of the aforementioned amendments, it is likely that a complex set of transitional rules will apply for employers and employees. A brief overview:\n\nTransitional law: If the 30% ruling was applied in the last wage tax period of 2022, then the cap applies as of 1 January 2026 (instead of 1 January 2024 .\n\nTransitional law: If the 30% ruling is applied in the last wage tax period of 2023, then the 30/20/10% ruling is not applicable during the duration of the 30% ruling. The salary cap on the 30% ruling (see point above) will be applicable (including its own transitional rules).\n\nTransitional law: If the 30% ruling is applied in the last wage tax period of 2023, then the partial non-resident taxpayer regime will no longer be available as of 1 January 2027 (instead of 1 January 2025 .\n\nFor all the aforementioned transitional provisions, it is likely that an employee will lose the transitional rights if they do not continuously meet the conditions of an incoming employee (“ingekomenwerknemer”). For instance, in the case of a change in employer, it will be essential that the end date of the initial employment and the start date of the new employment are aligned in order for the employee to remain entitled to the transitional law for the 30% ruling.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nFor now, we have to wait for the Dutch Senate (EersteKamer) to vote on the Tax Plan 2024, including the aforementioned changes of the 30% ruling. If the Dutch Senate votes in favour of the Tax Plan 2024, the proposed changes will become effective as of 1 January 2024 for amendment 1 and 1 January 2025 for amendment 2 (as indicated above; transitional law can apply for both amendments). The vote in the Senate is scheduled to take place on 19 December. It is expected that the proposed changes will be enacted.\n\nHow we can help\n\nAs Vialto Partners, we can assist you with the required steps to obtain insight into the impact of the (proposed) legislation on your workforce, how to communicate this to employees and new hires and to take action in anticipation of the upcoming changes, e.g. in relation to the impact from a finance, payroll and reward perspective.\n\nContact us\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com",

        "date": "February 1, 2023",
        "content": "30 January 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nWe would like to inform you about the most important updates of the wage tax law, which are relevant for employers in 2023.\n\nIncreased distance allowance\n\nAs part of the Tax Relief Act 2022, the German government has decided to increase the commuting allowance with retroactive effect from January 1, 2022. From 21km and above, a commuting allowance of EUR 0.38 per kilometer will apply (up to 20 km still EUR 0.30). This measure was originally planned to take effect in 2024 but was brought forward to 2022. For the employer, the increase has an impact on the flat wage tax for allowances for travel between home and the first place of work. If the employer reimburses the costs of family trips home in the case of double household tax-free at the level of the distance allowance, the increased amounts can be considered here.\n\nBasic Allowance\n\nEvery employee is entitled to an income tax-free amount, the so-called subsistence minimum. For 2023, it will be increased by EUR 561 to EUR 10,908.\n\nIncrease in the official non-cash remuneration values\n\nMeals that are provided to employees free of charge or at a reduced price on each working day are to be valued at the (pro rata) official non-cash remuneration value in accordance with the Social Security Remuneration Ordinance (Sozialversicherungsentgeltverordnung – SvEV). Accordingly, the value for meals provided as of calendar year 2023 is:\n\na) for a lunch or dinner – EUR 3.80;\nb) for a breakfast – EUR 2.00.\n\nIn the case of full board (breakfast, lunch and dinner), the meals are to be assessed at a value of EUR 9.60.\n\nThe employer can tax the non-cash benefit at a flat rate of 25% (plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge and, if applicable, flat church tax).\n\nSince 01.01.2023, the monthly benefit in kind for free or reduced-price accommodation is EUR 265.\n\nSolidarity surcharge\n\nThe exemption limit of EUR 16,956 previously will be raised to EUR 17,543 in 2023.\n\nTax treatment of travel expense reimbursements\n\nAs of January 1, 2023, the lump sum for the daily allowance and for accommodation costs for business trips abroad have been increased. The current amounts can be found in the overview of the applicable lump sums in the BMF letter dated November 23, 2022 (IV C 5 – S 2353/19/10010 :004).\n\nAllowances for moving expenses\n\nIn the event of a change of residence for work-related reasons, the employer may reimburse the employee for the costs incurred by him/her free of tax to the extent that they are deductible as income-related expenses. In principle, the actual relocation costs can be deducted as income-related expenses up to the maximum amount that could be paid as an allowance for relocation costs according to the Federal Relocation Costs Act (BUKG) and the Ordinance on the Allowance of Relocation Costs for Relocations Abroad (AUV).\n\nAccording to the new version of the Wage Tax Guidelines 2023 – regarding the return relocation costs from abroad to Germany – an approach of 100% of the lump sums is permitted, and no longer 80% of the lump sums, as was previously applicable. This applies to all relocations that take place from the 2023 tax year onwards.\n\nInflation compensation premium\n\nThe bonus can be voluntarily paid out by the employer to employees free of tax and social security contributions in the amount of EUR 3,000.\n\nThe benefit period is limited in time. It begins on October 26, 2022 and runs until December 31, 2024. It is a one-time tax allowance that cannot be claimed for every year. Nevertheless, the bonus can be paid in several installments. The bonus applies to one employment relationship at a time – thus it can be granted several times in the benefit period in the event of a change of employer.\n\nHowever, the tax exemption of the inflation compensation premium is subject to a condition: The bonus must be granted in addition to the wages owed.\n\nNew Wage Tax Guidelines 2023 – In particular, Changes regarding the Application of the Wage Tax Daily Table\n\nAs part of a comprehensive amendment of the 2015 wage tax guidelines by the German government, there are some significant changes in addition to pure changes in the wording. In particular, the adjustment made in R 35b.5 para. 2 LStR requires critical attention.\n\nSpecifically, the regulation contains the view of the tax authorities on how to deal with cases of temporary taxation of wages in payroll. The previous R 39b.5 para. 2 sentence 3 LStR provided for the application of the monthly wage tax table if the wages were paid monthly. According to the clear wording of the law, the decisive factor for the application of the wage tax table is the wage payment period. As of January 1, 2023, the application of the daily wage tax table is now planned. According to this (R 39b.5 para. 2 sentence 4 LStR 2023), working days on which the employee received wages that are not subject to German wage tax deduction (e.g. employment in Germany on a daily basis, receipt of tax-exempt wages under a double taxation agreement) will no longer be counted.\n\nThe consequence of this regulation is a higher tax burden, which should lead to an appropriate taxation according to the so-called benefit principle.\n\nAuslandstätigkeitserlass\n\nThe Foreign Activities Decree regulates the waiver of taxation on wages with regard to certain favored activities carried out abroad; provided that there is no double taxation agreement with the country (e.g. factories, construction works, commissioning of economic assets and exploitation of mineral resources).\n\nThe Foreign Activities Decree has been revised with effect from the 2023 assessment period. The new version of the Foreign Activities Decree introduces minimum taxation abroad for the first time and confirms the scope of application also for employers with their registered office, management, or permanent establishment in an EU/EEA country. In addition, the regulations have been adjusted in some places (e.g. with regard to favored and unfavored activities, etc.). The waiver of taxation in the wage tax deduction procedure must be applied for by the employer or employee at the permanent establishment tax office (so-called exemption certificate).\n\nPreviously, no proof of foreign taxation was required for the exemption of preferential wages. With the new decree, a minimum taxation abroad is now also required, which must be proven by the taxpayer. The minimum taxation is set at 10% and must correspond to the German income tax.\n\nContact:\n\nWe encourage you to contact our experts if you have any questions about the information above:\n• Marco Libudda, Director | marco.l.libudda@vialto.com\n• Anna Liepelt, Senior Manager | anna.l.liepelt@vialto.com\nMore information about Vialto Partners can be found at this link: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Canada | Immigration | Québec economic immigration program reforms & implementation of electronic filing of applications for the hiring of foreign workers",
        "date": "November 27, 2023",
        "content": "November 24, 2023\n\nCANADA: Coming into force of the Québec economic immigration program reforms in November 2023; implementation of electronic filing of applications for the hiring of foreign workers\n\nIn brief\n\nOn November 23, 2023, the Regulation amending the Québec Immigration Regulations came into force, with a few exceptions, bringing significant reforms to Québec economic immigration programs. In addition, the electronic filing of applications for job offers will come into force on December 11, 2023 and will be mandatory as of January 22, 2024.\n\nIn detail\n\n1. REFORM OF ECONOMIC IMMIGRATION PROGRAMS\n\nAs part of the reform of Québec economic immigration programs, a knowledge of French will now be required for those wishing to be selected to settle in Québec permanently. Here is an overview of the changes in the affected programs.\n\nA) Graduate Stream\n\nStarting November 23, 2023, foreign students graduating in Québec will be able to file a Certificate of Selection (Certificat de sélection du Québec or CSQ) application as part of the Québec Experience Program – Graduate Stream upon completion of their studies. As a result, they will no longer have to show any work experience in Québec nor confirm current employment at the time of their application.\n\nHowever, a knowledge of written French that corresponds to level 5 on the Québec scale of French proficiency levels is now added to the eligibility criteria. Previously, only a knowledge of spoken French was required.\n\nIn addition, as of November 23, 2024, these candidates must have completed their program of study in Québec in French. Alternatively, they must demonstrate having successfully completed at least three years of full-time secondary or post-secondary studies in French. These studies may have been done outside Québec.\n\nB) Temporary Foreign Workers Stream\n\nThe Temporary Foreign Workers Stream continues to require 24 months of work experience. However, following updates to the National Occupational Classification (NOC) system from the 2016 to the 2021 version, occupations in category TEER 3 are now eligible for this program. This change will allow candidates in many professions that do not require a college diploma to obtain their permanent residence in Québec more easily. For example, heavy equipment operators or even estheticians, electrologists and related occupations who were at skill level C based on the old NOC system are now in a TEER 3 category, and therefore are eligible for the Québec Experience Program.\n\nAs of November 29, 2024, the Regular Skilled Worker Program (RSWP) will be replaced by the Qualified Worker Selection Program (QWSP). This new program aims to select people who have a knowledge of French and have sufficient skills to meet the province’s labor shortage problem. This program includes four distinct streams, namely:\n\nThe knowledge of French, which was not a requirement under the RSWP, will now be mandatory under the QWSP. This requirement applies for streams 1 to 3 and will vary depending on the TEER category of the profession:\n\nThe only exception to these new requirements is stream 4, which has no French language requirements.\n\nFurthermore, under this new program, a selection grid will no longer be used for the selection of applicants.\n\nIn terms of work experience, requirements will vary depending on the chosen stream. Applicants must meet the following criteria:\n\nAs of January 1, 2024, the main applicants for the investors, entrepreneurs and self-employed workers programs will have to demonstrate a knowledge of oral French that corresponds to at least level 7.\n\nInvestors will also have to provide proof of a temporary stay in Québec for at least 12 months before obtaining their CSQ.\n\nAs of November 23, 2023, as part of sponsorship applications, guarantors will now have to submit an integration plan and commit to supporting French language studies for people between the ages of 18 to 55 they wish to sponsor.\n\n2. IMPLEMENTATION OF ELECTRONIC FILING OF APPLICATIONS\n\nTo simplify the procedures for Québec employers under the Regular Skilled Worker Program (RSWP) and Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) programs, the Ministry of Immigration, Francisation and Integration (MIFI) is introducing the electronic filing of applications for hiring foreign workers.\n\nThis tool will be available on the Arrima platform as of December 11, 2023 and will become mandatory starting January 22, 2024, except for agricultural employers and home care providers.\n\nThe Arrima platform will be used to submit the provincial part of LMIA applications in Québec, as well as applications for temporary selection under the TFWP, and applications for validation of a job offer under the RSWP. It will serve as a means to securely transmit documents and pay the fees electronically without the need to fill out any form as before. It will also be possible to communicate with the MIFI and follow the progress of the applications electronically.\n\nIt should be noted that employers will be able to apply for unnamed LMIA applications, meaning that they will not need to identify the names of their candidates in advance. Once such LMIA applications have been submitted, the employer can submit the names of candidates at a later date, after suitable candidates have been located.\n\nFurther, a paper copy of the Québec acceptance certificate (CAQ) for workers will no longer be issued, but rather a CAQ attestation letter which will be transmitted in the online profile.\n\nContact us\n\nFor further details regarding this, or any other immigration matter, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nNadine Landry\nPartner, Immigration\nnadine.landry@vialto.com\n\nCANADA: Entrée en vigueur de la réforme des programmes d’immigration économique au Québec de novembre 2023; mise en place de la transmission électronique des demandes pour l’embauche de travailleurs étrangers\n\nEn bref\n\nLe 23 novembre 2023, le Règlement modifiant le Règlement sur l’immigration au Québec entre en vigueur, à quelques exceptions près, apportant une réforme importante aux programmes d’immigration économique du Québec. De plus, la transmission électronique des demandes (TED) visant les offres d’emploi entrera en vigueur le 11 décembre 2023 et sera obligatoire à compter du 22 janvier 2024.\n\nEn détail\n\n1. RÉFORME DES PROGRAMMES D’IMMIGRATION ÉCONOMIQUE\n\nDans le cadre de la réforme des programmes d’immigration économique au Québec, une connaissance du français sera désormais exigée pour les personnes souhaitant être sélectionnées pour s’établir au Québec de façon permanente. Voici un survol des changements dans les programmes visés.\n\nA) Volet des diplômés\n\nÀ partir du 23 novembre 2023, les étudiants étrangers diplômés au Québec pourront soumettre une demande de CSQ dans le cadre du Programme de l’expérience québécoise (PEQ) – Volet des diplômés dès la fin de leurs études. De ce fait, ils n’auront plus à justifier d’une expérience de travail au Québec et d’être encore à l’emploi au moment de la demande.\n\nCependant, la connaissance du français écrit de niveau 5 à l’échelle québécoise des niveaux de compétence en français s’ajoute désormais aux critères d’éligibilité. Auparavant, on ne devait démontrer que des connaissances verbales.\n\nDe plus, à partir du 23 novembre 2024, ces candidats devront obligatoirement avoir complété leur programme d’études au Québec en français. À défaut, ils devront justifier d’au moins trois années d’études secondaires ou postsecondaires à temps plein en français. Ces études pourront avoir été réalisées hors Québec.\n\nB) Volet des travailleurs étrangers\n\nConcernant le volet des travailleurs étrangers, l’exigence de 24 mois d’expérience professionnelle demeure. Toutefois, suite à la mise à jour des codes de la nouvelle Classification nationale des professions (CNP) 2021 qui remplacent celles de 2016, les emplois de catégorie FÉER 3 sont désormais admissibles au programme. Cela permet maintenant à de nombreuses professions qui ne nécessitent pas de diplôme d’études collégiales d’obtenir plus facilement la résidence permanente au Québec. Par exemple, les  conducteurs d’équipement lourd ou encore les esthéticiens, électrolystes et personnel assimilé qui étaient de  niveau de compétence C selon l’ancienne CNP sont maintenant de catégorie FÉER 3 et deviennent donc éligibles au PEQ.\n\nÀ compter du 29 novembre 2024, le Programme régulier des travailleurs qualifiés (PRTQ) deviendra désormais le Programme de sélection des travailleurs qualifiés (PSTQ). Ce nouveau programme vise à sélectionner des personnes connaissant le français et ayant les compétences suffisantes pour répondre aux besoins de la main-d’œuvre de la province. Il comprend quatre volets distincts, soit :\n\nLa connaissance du français, qui n’était pas une exigence sous le PRTQ, sera désormais obligatoire sous le PSTQ pour les volets 1 à 3 et variera en fonction du niveau de qualification de la profession exercée:\n\nLa seule exception à ces nouvelles exigences est le volet 4 sous lequel aucune exigence de maîtrise du français n’est prévue.\n\nDe plus, dans ce nouveau programme, la grille de pointage ne sera plus utilisée pour la sélection des demandeurs.\n\nPour ce qui est de l’expérience de travail requise, les exigences varient selon le volet choisi. Le demandeur devra donc démontrer une expérience de travail:\n\nÀ compter du 1er janvier 2024, les demandeurs principaux des programmes des investisseurs, des entrepreneurs et des travailleurs autonomes devront justifier minimalement d’une connaissance du français oral de niveau 7.\n\nLes investisseurs devront également faire la preuve d’un séjour au Québec à titre temporaire pendant au moins 12 mois avant l’obtention du CSQ.\n\nDès le 23 novembre 2023, dans le cadre des demandes de parrainage, les garants devront désormais soumettre un plan d’intégration et s’engager à soutenir l’apprentissage du français aux personnes parrainées qui sont âgées de 18 à 55 ans.\n\n2. MISE EN PLACE DE LA TRANSMISSION ÉLECTRONIQUE DES DEMANDES\n\nDans le but de simplifier les démarches pour les employeurs québécois dans le cadre des programmes PRTQ et PTET, le ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration (MIFI) met en place la transmission électronique des demandes (TED) pour l’embauche de travailleurs étrangers.\n\nCet outil sera disponible sur la plateforme Arrima dès le 11 décembre 2023 et sera obligatoire à compter du 22 janvier 2024, sauf pour les employeurs agricoles et fournisseurs de soins à domicile.\n\nAinsi, la plateforme Arrima sera utilisée pour déposer la partie provinciale des demandes d’EIMT au Québec, des demandes de sélection temporaire dans le cadre du PTET ou des demandes de validation d’une offre d’emploi dans le cadre du PRTQ. Elle servira de moyen pour transmettre de façon sécurisée les documents, effectuer le paiement des droits exigibles par voie électronique et non plus par formulaire. Il sera aussi possible de communiquer avec le Ministère et suivre l’avancement des dossiers électroniquement.\n\nIl y a lieu de noter qu’il sera possible de faire des demandes d’EIMT dénominalisée, c’est-à-dire sans avoir à identifier le nom des candidats à l’avance. Le nom des candidats pourra être complété ultérieurement dès que l’employeur aura trouvé son candidat.\n\nEn outre, il n’y aura plus de copie papier du certificat d’acceptation du Québec (CAQ) pour les travailleurs, mais plutôt une lettre d’attestation de CAQ qui  sera transmise dans le profil en ligne.\n\nVous voulez en savoir plus?\n\nPour plus d’informations sur ce qui précède ou sur toute autre question relative à l’immigration, veuillez communiquer avec votre point de contact chez Vialto Partners, ou:\n\nNadine Landry\nAssociée, Immigration\nnadine.landry@vialto.com",

Flights from the Dominican Republic, Peru and Panama to Venezuela have been cancelled.\n\nThe detail\n\nOn July 30th, current President Nicolas Maduro ordered the withdrawal of diplomatic personnel in Caracas from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Peru, Panama, Dominican Republic and Uruguay.

        "title": "United States | Post US election: What now for immigration and tax?",
        "date": "November 8, 2024",
        "content": "President-elect Donald Trump will be heading back to the White House and his Republican Party will also be in control in at least one of the two legislative chambers, the Senate. The control of the other chamber—the House of Representatives—remains uncertain at the time of writing, but if the Republicans retain control, President-elect Trump’s ability to pass legislation will increase.\n\nAs immigration policy will be a top priority for the newly elected President (as noted in his first interview following his win), companies should be prepared for a flurry of already-drafted, immigration-related executive actions, which do not need additional approvals, to be published soon after his inauguration day on January 20, 2025, and within the first 100 days of the new administration. Mobility professionals should take proactive measures in the run-up to the inauguration to prepare.\n\nWe anticipate changes to tax legislation as well, but this will take a longer time so no immediate action is required. However, mobility professionals should stay apprised of the tax process as it unfolds during 2025.\n\nBased on Vialto’s understanding of the new administration’s objectives, here are some key areas companies should focus on in the coming months:\n\n(1 ) Make sure your immigration program is compliant with immigration regulations\n\nImmigration compliance will play a major role in a new Trump administration. Companies should anticipate that the new administration will greatly strengthen governmental agencies to investigate and possibly sanction companies over non-compliance. Companies should therefore assess the level of their immigration compliance and take prompt corrective measures if lapses are identified.\n\nHow can Vialto help? Immigration Program Compliance reviews and compliance tools.\n\nVialto offers a complete immigration program assessment focusing on areas of non-compliance and offering remedial actions. The review may include:\n\nVialto also offers several compliance tools that will ensure companies continue to remain compliant with immigration and labor laws, including our Form I-9 Compliance tool.\n\n(2) Assess who among your population are most at risk of losing work authorization or legal status in the US\n\nSpokespersons for the new administration have previously indicated they will eliminate protections for certain categories of immigrants who are in the United States and currently have work authorization. The populations that are the most at-risk of losing their immigration status and work authorization in the US, because they were granted either by executive order or by immigration agency action, rather than law, include the following:\n\nHow can Vialto help? Visa impact assessments.\n\nVialto can perform a visa impact assessment to identify alternative options.\n\n(3) Review your foreign national population and see who may be impacted by a potential travel ban or slowdown in travel\n\nThe newly elected administration has previously indicated that they will implement travel bans on citizens from certain countries. The travel bans will be similar to ones that President Trump instituted in his first administration, which introduced blanket bans on specific nationalities.   Accordingly, there are several steps that companies can take to prepare:\n\nHow can Vialto help? Webinars on potential travel impacts and training for HR professionals.\n\nVialto can provide educational town halls to HR professionals and employees that may be impacted, as well as recommendations on what to do if they are abroad when a travel ban is issued.\n\n(4) Inventory your entire foreign national population\n\nGiven the realistic potential to see travel bans and slowdowns of visa issuance at the US State Department (US Immigration department), we would strongly recommend companies create an inventory of their non-citizen population and confirm:\n\nPlease note that It is possible that even green card holders may be at risk of being temporarily stranded abroad if new and likely enhanced travel bans are announced without forewarning.\n\nHow can Vialto help? Impact assessments on your foreign national population.\n\nVialto’s advisory team can review your entire population and determine which employees may be impacted. We can also provide town hall meetings and one-on-one information sessions to support these populations.\n\n(5) Develop an internal communications strategy\n\nCompanies should consider creating a dedicated internal communications strategy to cascade alerts and corporate policies relating to any developments of importance or concern.\n\nHow can Vialto help? Develop strategies and communications to send to impacted employees.\n\nVialto can help develop a communications strategy and draft communications to send to impacted employees on recent immigration changes or corporate policies. Vialto can work with HR professionals to support non-citizen workers to provide reassurance and help them deal with the challenges ahead through open houses, office hours, and one-on-one consultations.\n\n(6) Increase awareness of potential tax law changes\n\nTax law changes will go through the legislative process rather than executive action, so immediate changes are not expected. Remain aware of the direction tax legislation discussions take in 2025 once the new Congress sits, including these focus areas for mobility professionals:\n\nHow can Vialto help? Develop strategies and communications to send to impacted employees.\n\nVialto will continue providing you with updates on the progression of legislative activity through webinars, alerts and tailored advice through your engagement team. We can assist with reviewing your mobility and tax policies and updating program cost assumptions with respect to any tax law changes and help you to communicate those changes to internal stakeholders.\n\nUpcoming Webinars\n\nWe know there are many questions around how immigration and tax will change in the next few months.  Accordingly, Vialto will host a series of post-election webinars in the weeks ahead to help you navigate through this time period.  Below is a schedule of our upcoming webinars.\n\nThursday, November 14th at 1:30pm EST: Preparing for the impact of a President Trump administration on US immigration and tax policy\nRegister here\n\nWednesday, November 20th at 11:00am EST:  What anticipated immigration policy changes in the United States could mean for global immigration\nRegister here\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nImmigration:\nManish Daftari\nPartner\nAngelo Paparelli\nPartner\n\nTax:\nJulie Baron\nPartner\nRon Schiess\nPartner\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education systems are linked and will enable authorities to identify whether or not a child is enrolled.\n\nWhat this means\n\nIf a child is not enrolled in any school in Qatar, their renewal application may still be processed by visiting the Main Immigration department on an exceptional basis and therefore approval cannot be guaranteed.\n\nIt is important for employers to discuss this new rule with employees who have dependent children, to ensure that the requirements can be met at the time of renewal and/or expectations are met especially where children may have a Resident Permit but are not physically based in Qatar for the majority of time.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe will continue to closely monitor and provide timely guidance on any new updates by the Ministry of Interior and highlight the impact of any changes that may follow.\n\nContact us\n\nShould you have further questions on this update, please reach out to:\n\nAnir Chatterji\nMiddle East Immigration Leader\nanir.chatterji@vialto.com\n\nRekha Simpson\nDirector, Middle East Immigration\nrekha.simpson@vialto.com\n\nMarilyn Serrao\nSenior Associate, Middle East Immigration\nmarilyn.serrao@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com",

        "date": "November 20, 2024",
        "content": "A new ruling by the Austrian Supreme Administrative Court expands the group of individuals eligible for Austrian (dual) citizenship based on being a descendent to a victim of the Nazi regime.\n\nSince September 2020 Austrian citizenship law grants citizenship to a descendant of a person who was persecuted by the Nazi regime or feared persecution (the “anchor person”) and thus had to leave Austria. Prior to 2020 this possibility to “regain” Austrian citizenship was only available to the anchor person individually. This procedure is special, because it allows for a descendant of the “anchor person” to obtain Austrian citizenship, regardless of their current citizenship and residence. As a result, it also, permits dual citizenship.\n\nFor the citizenship to be granted to descendants it was typically (among other criteria) required that the anchor person had to have left Austria prior to 1955 (as Austrian citizen) and subsequently lost their citizenship. Uncertainties arose in cases where the anchor persons themselves never lost Austrian citizenship but nonetheless their descendants – due to different reasons – were not Austrian nationals.\n\nA recent ruling by the Supreme Administrative Court has now clarified that it is not relevant whether the anchor person lost Austrian citizenship. Their descendants – children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren who hold a different citizenship – can still invoke the law and be granted citizenship by descent. This is provided all other legal requirements are met, such as in particular that the anchor person was persecuted or feared persecution in the first place.\n\nThis ruling significantly expands the group of individuals eligible for Austrian (dual) citizenship and could lead to a new increase in applications.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nValentina Arnez\nPartner, Attorney at Law (Arnez Rechtsanwalts GmbH*) & Immigration Expert,\n\nAntonia Lehne\nManager (Arnez Rechtsanwalts GmbH*) & Immigration Expert,\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\n* Please note that Arnez Rechtsanwalts GmbH is cooperating with the Vialto Partners network and is a member to the Vienna Bar Association, registered as an independent legal entity under Commercial register No. FN 596972a.\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Germany | Annual tax law 2024",
        "date": "December 16, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nSummary\n\nOn November 22, 2024, the Federal Council approved the Annual Tax Act 2024 (JStG). The law was announced on December 5, 2024. The following newsletter gives you an overview of relevant changes for employers in the area of wage tax.\n\nDetails\n\nThe scope of application of Section 19a of the German Income Tax Act (EStG), i.e. the option of deferred taxation of equity participations in micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, has been extended to group holdings. The tax incentive can now also be applied to the transfer of shares in associated companies, provided that the thresholds of section 19a (3) EStG are not exceeded in relation to the totality of all group companies and that none of the associated companies is older than 20 years. This regulation applies retroactively from the 2024 assessment period.\n\nThe partial relief amount for single parents can now be formed as an allowance for the wage tax deduction procedure from the month of separation, if the spouses/life partners have been living apart permanently and the other requirements of § 24b EStG are met. In subsequent years, the relief amount for single parents can only be taken into account with tax class II. This amendment shall take effect on the day following promulgation of the law.\n\nThe planned introduction of a mobility budget was rejected and was not implemented in the annual tax law.\n\nAll flat-rate wage tax options are now exercised by submitting the wage tax registration. However, the previously required application must be submitted separately if applicable. In addition, the employer can also exercise the option to apply a flat rate of tax to the responsible tax office (in writing or electronically) as part of a wage tax audit. Such a declaration must be submitted at the latest by the time the assessments issued as a result of the audit become final. The regulation applies to all open cases.\n\nIn cases where the employer can no longer withhold the wage tax (from previously untaxed wages) retrospectively because the employee no longer receives a wage from the employer or because the employer has already submitted the wage tax certificate after the end of the calendar year, the employer must notify the responsible tax office without delay. The Annual Tax Act 2024 now stipulates that an electronic form of transmission is to be used for this notification in the future. This requirement will come into force on January 1, 2026.\n\nThe annual adjustment of wage tax is excluded in the case of foreign income, from which no German wage tax was withheld (§ 42b, paragraph 1, sentence 3, no. 6 EStG). This regulation applies retroactively from the 2024 assessment period.\n\nThe catalog of limited taxable income in § 49, para. 1, no. 4 of the German Income Tax Act (EStG) was supplemented by lit. f), according to which income from employment is now also considered German income in the sense of limited tax liability, which is granted for periods of revocable or irrevocable leave from work in connection with the termination of an employment relationship. The prerequisite is that the work would have been carried out in Germany without the leave. This change applies from the day after the promulgation of the law.\n\nThe new Section 50d (15) of the German Income Tax Act (EStG) also anchors the understanding of the release from work with regard to the interpretation of the double taxation agreement. Accordingly, remuneration paid for revocable or irrevocable leave in connection with the termination of the employment relationship is deemed to be remuneration granted for the pursuit of an activity in the country in which the activity would have been pursued had the leave not been granted. This shall not apply to the extent that the double taxation agreement contains a different provision expressly concerning such remuneration or that specific consultation arrangements exist. This amendment shall also take effect on the day following the promulgation of the law.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMathias Schmitt\nPartner, Steuerberater\n\nAnna Liepelt\nSenior Manager, Steuerberaterin\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nZusammenfassung\n\nAm 22. November 2024 hat der Bundesrat dem Jahressteuergesetz 2024 (JStG) zugestimmt. Am 05. Dezember 2024 wurde das Gesetz verkündet. Der folgende Newsletter gibt Ihnen einen Überblick über relevante Änderungen für Arbeitgeber im Bereich der Lohnsteuer.\n\nDetails\n\nDer Anwendungsbereich des § 19a EStG, d.h. die Möglichkeit der aufgeschobenen Besteuerung von Vermögensbeteiligungen bei Kleinstunternehmen sowie kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen, wurde auf Konzernbeteiligungen erweitert. Die Steuervergünstigungen können nun auch bei Übertragung von Anteilen verbundener Unternehmen angewendet werden, sofern die Schwellenwerte des § 19a Abs. 3 EStG bezogen auf die Gesamtheit aller Konzernunternehmen nicht überschritten werden und keines der verbundenen Unternehmen älter als 20 Jahre ist. Diese Regelung gilt rückwirkend ab dem Veranlagungszeitraum 2024.\n\nDer anteilige Entlastungsbetrag für Alleinerziehende kann bei dauerndem Getrenntleben der Ehegatten/Lebenspartner, nun ab dem Monat der Trennung als Freibetrag für das Lohnsteuerabzugsverfahren gebildet werden, wenn die übrigen Voraussetzungen des § 24b EStG erfüllt sind. In Folgejahren kann der Entlastungsbetrag für Alleinerziehende ausschließlich über die Steuerklasse II berücksichtigt werden. Diese Änderung gilt ab dem Tag nach der Verkündung des Gesetzes.\n\nDie geplante Einführung eines Mobilitätsbudgets wurde verworfen und wurde im Jahressteuergesetz nicht umgesetzt.\n\nAusübung aller lohnsteuerlichen Pauschalierungswahlrechte nach § 40 Abs. 4 EStG\n\nDie Ausübung aller lohnsteuerlichen Pauschalierungswahlrechte erfolgt nun grundsätzlich durch Übermittlung der Lohnsteueranmeldung. Davon zu trennen ist allerdings ggf. der vorher notwendige Antrag. Außerdem kann der Arbeitgeber auch gegenüber dem Betriebsstättenfinanzamt (schriftlich oder elektronisch) im Rahmen einer Lohnsteuer-Außenprüfung das Pauschalierungswahlrecht ausüben. Eine solche Erklärung ist spätestens bis zur Bestandskraft der aus der Prüfung ergangenen Bescheide abzugeben. Die Regelung gilt in allen offenen Fällen.\n\nIn Fällen, in denen der Arbeitgeber die Lohnsteuer (von bisher versteuerten Arbeitslohn) nicht mehr nachträglich einbehalten kann, weil der Arbeitnehmer vom Arbeitgeber keinen Arbeitslohn mehr bezieht oder der Arbeitgeber nach Ablauf des Kalenderjahres bereits die Lohnsteuerbescheinigung übermittelt oder ausgeschrieben hat, hat er dies dem zuständigen Betriebsstättenfinanzamt unverzüglich anzuzeigen. Im Jahressteuergesetz 2024 ist nun verankert, dass für diese Anzeige zukünftig eine elektronische Form der Übermittlung zu nutzen ist. Diese Anforderung tritt am 01. Januar 2026 in Kraft.\n\nLohnsteuerjahresausgleich nach § 42b EStG\n\nDer Lohnsteuerjahresausgleich ist ausgeschlossen bei Bezug ausländischer Einkünfte, von denen keine inländische Lohnsteuer einbehalten wurde (§ 42b Abs. 1 S. 3 Nr. 6 EStG). Diese Regelung gilt rückwirkend ab dem Veranlagungszeitraum 2024.\n\nErgänzt wurde der Katalog beschränkt steuerpflichtiger Einkünfte in § 49 Abs. 1 Nr. 4 EStG um lit. f), nach welchem nun auch Einkünfte aus nichtselbstständiger Arbeit als inländische Einkünfte im Sinne der beschränkten Steuerpflicht gelten, welche für Zeiten der widerruflichen oder unwiderruflichen Arbeitsfreistellung in Zusammenhang mit einer Beendigung des Arbeitsverhältnisses gewährt werden. Voraussetzung ist, dass die Arbeit ohne die Freistellung im Inland ausgeübt worden wäre. Diese Änderung gilt ab dem Tag nach der Verkündung des Gesetzes.\n\nDer neue § 50d Abs. 15 EStG verankert das Verständnis zur Arbeitsfreistellung auch bezüglich der Auslegung der Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen. Demnach gilt Arbeitslohn, der für Zeiten einer widerruflichen oder unwiderruflichen Arbeitsfreistellung im Zusammenhang mit der Beendigung des Arbeitsverhältnisses gezahlt wird, als Vergütung, die für die Ausübung einer Tätigkeit in dem Staat gewährt wird, in dem die Tätigkeit ohne die Freistellung ausgeübt worden wäre. Dies gilt nicht, soweit das Abkommen in einer gesonderten, ausdrücklich solchen Arbeitslohn betreffenden Vorschrift eine abweichende Regelung trifft oder spezifische Konsultationsvereinbarungen bestehen. Diese Änderung gilt ebenfalls ab dem Tag nach der Verkündung des Gesetzes.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMathias Schmitt\nPartner, Steuerberater\n\nAnna Liepelt\nSenior Manager, Steuerberaterin\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

Small changes to income tax thresholds at the basic and intermediate rates are welcomed, but still sees Scottish taxpayers having to pay more than their counterparts in the rest of the UK.\n\nThe detail\n\nNo changes to Scottish income tax rates but changes to tax bands at lower income levels\n\nThe Scottish Government has kept Scottish rates of income tax unchanged for 2025/26 but it has slightly increased the tax bands at the lower levels.  The income tax rates and bands for Scottish Taxpayers for 2025/26 are as follows.\n\n\n\nTop of band increased by £931\n\nThe Scottish Rate of Income Tax applies to employment and self-employment income earned by people who are resident in Scotland (“Scottish Taxpayers”).  It is set by the Scottish Government.  However, the Westminster government sets certain tax rates for the whole of the UK, including Scotland.  These Westminster-set rates include:\n\nOnly people who are resident in Scotland for income tax purposes pay Scottish rates of income tax.  A person who is not tax resident in the UK will pay the main UK rates of income tax on any UK-sourced income, even if this income is earned in Scotland.\n\nBecause National Insurance is set in Westminster for the whole of the UK, the increase in the rate of Class 1 employer NICs from 13.8% to 15%, as announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Autumn Budget, will apply to employers of Scottish residents and non-Scottish residents alike.\n\nThe tax rates and bands outlined above are expected to generate approximately £1.4 billion in additional revenue for the Scottish Government in 2025/26 compared to the previous year.\n\nEffect of the new tax bands on taxpayers\n\nIf earning the same amount of employment or self-employment income as last year, all Scottish taxpayers earning above £14,877 will be slightly better off.  The increases in the tax bands at the lower levels will benefit them. The maximum benefit will be for people earning above £27,492 (the top of the Basic rate band for 2025/26), but the tax reduction is less than £15 per person over the whole tax year.\n\nThe Scottish Fiscal Commission estimates that, because of decisions on Scottish tax rates and thresholds, an additional £1.7 billion income tax will be raised in 2025/26 than would be the case if tax rates and thresholds from the rest of the UK were applied in Scotland.  The Commission forecasts Scottish income tax revenue for 2025/25 to be £20.5 billion, so the extra tax raised by taking a different path from the rest of the UK represents about 8.2% of the Scottish government’s income tax revenue.\n\n\n\nCouncil tax: The Scottish Government announced that in 2025/26 it will increase local authority funding by more than £1 billion.  However, it did not continue the council tax freeze that applied for 2024/25.  Whether council taxes for residents rise in 2025/26 will depend on what councils receive and what they consider their spending needs are.\n\nBusiness rates: The Basic Property Rate or “poundage” (i.e. rate at which the levy is imposed) for business rates has been frozen for 2025/26 at 49.8 pence per £1.  This applies to business properties with a rateable value up to £51,000.  The Intermediate Property Rate, for properties with a rateable value between £51,000 and £100,000, and the Higher Property Rate, for properties with rateable values above £100,000, are both increased in line with inflation and for 2025/26 will be 55.4p and 56.8p in the £1 respectively.\n\nThe thresholds of rateable values for the basic, intermediate and higher bands remain unchanged.  This may be watched more closely next year because the next review of the rateable values of business properties is scheduled for 1 April 2026 with a tone date of 1 April 2025.\n\nRecognising the specific challenges faced by the hospitality sector in island communities, the Scottish Government will again offer 100 per cent relief in 2025/26 for hospitality businesses located on islands as defined by the Islands (Scotland) Act 2018 and in three prescribed remote areas (Cape Wrath, Knoydart and Scoraig), capped at £110,000 per business.\n\nLand and Buildings Transaction Tax: There are no changes to Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) for 2025/26.  For residential properties, an Additional Dwelling Supplement (ADS) will increase from 6% to 8% with effect from 5 December 2024.  This is charged in addition to normal LBTT on purchases of all relevant residential properties for £40,000 and above.\n\nPublic Health Supplement: The government announced that it has no plans to reintroduce the Public Health Supplement at this time.  This was a supplementary business rate on large retailers that sold both alcohol and tobacco. It was in place between April 2012 and March 2015. Effectively, around 240 large supermarket outlets in Scotland paid the supplement, and the government had committed to exploring the idea of reintroducing it.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nGemma Buxton\nDirector\n\nTim Sexton\nDirector\n\nJamie Greig\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Business Travel Solutions\n\nEuropean Union | Delayed go-live for the Entry-Exit System (EES) and the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS)\n\nSummary\n\nThe European Union’s Entry-Exit System (EES), which was scheduled for launch on 10 November, has been postponed and may be revised, according to the latest updates from EU officials.This delay also impacts the related European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), which has been postponed indefinitely.\n\nThe detail\n\nThe EES\n\nWhat is the Entry-Exit System?\nThe Entry/Exit System (EES) will digitally register the data of non-EU citizens every time they enter and exit the external Schengen borders and will replace the physical stamping of passports at passport control. This will impact short-term travelers to Europe, collecting information for both visa and visa-free nationals, whether they are traveling for business or tourism.\n\nThe European Commission had confirmed in Summer 2024 that it will launch on 10th November 2024. Further delays have now been announced, with a pilot program expected in 2025. The project, which has seen substantial investment, particularly in the UK, has faced resistance from Member States like France, Germany, and the Netherlands over its readiness and potential to cause border delays.\n\nThe European Commission’s current proposal is to implement the system in a phased manner. The system will likely be piloted in select airports and border points, with biometric requirements, such as fingerprinting and facial recognition, reduced to alternatives rather than mandatory procedures.\n\nThis change has raised questions about the future structure of the EES and its impact on travellers. As of now, there is no new definitive go-live date.\n\nContact us\n\nVialto Partners can help preparing business travellers and Business Travel Programs with these upcoming developments.

        "content": "September 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nIf implemented, non-resident employers will be required to deduct and remit South African employee’s tax (Pay As You Earn) from employee’s remuneration. This monthly compliance obligation will be in line with requirements presently, in place for South African resident employers.\n\nThis change will bring considerable administrative obligations and challenges to non-resident employers who have employees in South Africa (such as requirements on opening of company bank accounts, authority registrations and filings).\n\nEarly planning, in anticipation of such a provision being implemented, is recommended. The effective date of this proposed change has not yet been set.\n\nThe Detail\n\nThe recently released Tax Administration Laws Amendment Bill of 2023 makes provision for legislative amendment requiring non-resident employers to withhold and remit PAYE on employee remuneration. Up to now there has not been an income tax withholding obligation on non-resident employers, with taxes being otherwise payable through the individual filing of provisional (IRP6) and annual (ITR12) returns to the tax authorities.\n\nMany non-resident employers have voluntarily registered and remitted PAYE in order to comply with pre-existing remittance obligations of South African social levies (being the capped employee/employer Unemployment Insurance Fund and the uncapped employer Skills Development Levy), or the related requirements have been fulfilled by a representative employer that the company has in South Africa (where the representative employer has had the tax and social levy withholding obligation).\n\nIf implemented this requirement of registration, withholding and remittance will become compulsory on the non-resident employer. Interest and penalty exposures would apply for non- compliance.\n\nAdministrative and compliance challenges presented by this, under current processes, will be considerable. It remains to be seen if there will be any simplification to facilitate non-resident employers in these new obligations.\n\nWhat is next?\n\nVialto Partners South Africa, through tax practitioner representative bodies, will be making extensive submissions on this proposal and seeking clarity on a number of anomalies created as a result of this proposed change.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n• Claire Abraham, Senior Manager | claire.abraham@vialto.com\n• Kesiree Mari, Director | krishnavenee.mari@vialto.com\n• Gavin Duffy, Partner | gavin.duffy@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "27 November 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nCzech Republic | Proposed changes to individual income taxation\n\nImpact High\n\nSummary\n\nThe Act on the Consolidation of Public Budgets has recently been approved by the President, and most of the provisions are proposed to come into effect from 1 January 2024. This bulletin provides an overview of key changes in personal income tax area included in the consolidation package.\n\nThe Detail\n\n1. Personal Income Tax Rates\n\nThe annual threshold for applying the marginal 23% personal income tax rate will be reduced to 36 times the average annual wage (currently 48 times) i.e., for the 2024 tax year, the individual’s annual tax base up to CZK 1 582 812 will be subject to 15% tax rate, while the tax base above will be subject to 23% tax rate.\n\n2. Changes in the Employee Benefits\n\nEmployee non-monetary benefits (e.g., school fees, medical treatment, cultural and sport facilities, etc.) will retain their tax advantage, but up to an annual limit set at half the average monthly wage (CZK 21,983 for 2024) only.\n\nThere will be a unified limit for tax exemption of cash meal allowances and non-monetary meal\nvouchers. Additionally, as of 2024 a second meal allowance can be provided for working shifts\nlonger than 11 hours.\n\n3. Increase in Social Security and Health Insurance Duties for Self-Employed Individuals\n\nSelf-employed individuals will be affected by an increase of assessment base for calculation of their mandatory social security and health insurance contributions from the current 50% to 55% of the income tax base.\n\n4. Sickness Insurance\n\nThe employee’s social security rate will rise from 6.5% to 7.1% due to sickness insurance newly covered also by employees.\n\n5. Abolition of Certain Deductions and Tax Credits\n\nThe student tax credit and tax credit for placing a child in pre-school facilities will be abolished. The tax credit for a spouse will apply only to the spouse with own annual income lower than CZK 68 000 who lives in a joint household caring for a child under three years.\n\n6. Proposed Changes to Pension Contribution Regulations\n\nThere is a suggestion to introduce a single annual cap of CZK 48,000 to reduce the taxpayer’s income tax base. This cap would encompass the total of the existing limits for deductible contributions, specifically CZK 24,000 per year for voluntary pension insurance and CZK 24,000 per year for private life insurance. Newly, this unified limit would be applicable also to contributions made towards tax-efficient retirement savings long-term investment product.\n\n7. Limitation on Tax Exemption of Income from Sale of Securities and Shares\n\nThere will be a further limit on tax exempt income from the sale of securities or shares already meeting an ownership time test of three years for securities and five years for other shares in a corporation. The proposed limitation, effective from 1 January 2025, will set a maximum of CZK 40 million of gross income from security/share sales to be tax exempt per taxpayer/year.\n\n8. Limit for Tax Exemption of Other Income\n\nA new annual limit of CZK 50,000 will be introduced for certain “other” types of income. Also, the limit for tax exempted donations received from one donor will increase from the current CZK 15,000 to CZK 50,000 for the tax period.\n\n9. Emission-Free Vehicle Taxation\n\nIf a company-owned emission-free vehicle is used by employee for both private and business purposes, 0.25% of the car’s entry price will be taxed as noncash income of the employee per each month during which the employee is entitled to use the company car.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nPetra Bobkova\nDirector \npetra.bobkova@vialto.com\n\nAlice Jurkova\nManager\nalice.jurkova@vialto.com\n\nDaniela Kralova\nManager \ndaniela.kralova@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com",

Effective March 19, 2024, spouses and common law partners of study permit holders will only be eligible for an open work permit if the primary applicant is studying in a Masters, Doctoral or select professional degree program.\n\nThe detail\nIn January 2024, the Honorable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) announced the first stage in the Government’s plans to reform Canada’s international student program. As part of these reforms, which include a cap on the number of international study permit applications to be accepted as well as changes to eligibility for a post-graduate work permit, the Minister announced plans to limit eligibility for spouses and common-law partners of international students to apply for an open work permit.\n\nNew eligibility criteria\nEffective March 19, 2024, spouses and common-law partners of international study permit holders will only be eligible to apply for an open spousal work permit if their spouse (the Principal Applicant) holds a valid study permit and is studying in either:\n\nProof of enrollment in one of the above programs of study will be required as part of the application, along with proof of relationship and other standard work permit documents.

À compter du 19 mars 2024, les époux et conjoints de fait des titulaires de permis d’études seront admissibles à un permis de travail ouvert seulement si le demandeur principal fait ses études dans un programme de maîtrise, de doctorat ou dans un des programmes professionnels sélectionnés.\n\nEn détail\nEn janvier 2024, l’honorable Marc Miller, ministre d’Immigration, Réfugiés et Citoyenneté Canada (IRCC), a annoncé la première phase des projets du gouvernement visant à réformer le programme des étudiants étrangers du Canada. Dans le cadre de ces réformes, qui incluent la mise en place temporaire d’un plafond national de réception des demandes de permis d’études ainsi que des changements à l’admissibilité aux permis de travail postdiplômes, le ministre a annoncé son intention de limiter l’admissibilité des époux et conjoints de fait des étudiants étrangers à demander un permis de travail ouvert.\n\nNouveaux critères d’admissibilité\nÀ partir du 19 mars 2024, les époux et conjoints de fait des titulaires de permis d’études ne pourront demander un permis de travail ouvert pour conjoint que si leur conjoint (le demandeur principal) détient un permis d’études valide et étudie dans l’un des programmes suivants :\n\nUne preuve d’inscription à l’un des programmes d’études ci-dessus sera requise dans le cadre de la demande, de même qu’une preuve de relation et d’autres documents standard de permis de travail. Conformément au processus actuel, les candidats approuvés recevront un permis de travail « ouvert », les autorisant à travailler pour n’importe quel employeur pour la même durée que le permis d’études du demandeur principal (ou jusqu’à l’expiration de leur passeport, la première de ces dates étant retenue).\n\nLes conjoints des titulaires de permis d’études qui sont inscrits à un programme de premier cycle non répertorié ci-dessus, ou qui n’ont pas de preuve suffisante de leur inscription dans un établissement d’enseignement désigné, ne seront pas admissibles à un permis de travail ouvert et devront présenter une demande de statut au Canada en fonction de leur propre situation.\n\nExceptions\nLes nouveaux critères d’admissibilité s’appliquent à toutes les nouvelles demandes de permis de travail ouvert pour conjoint déposées à compter du 19 mars 2024.

        "title": "Uruguay | Income Tax | Uruguay proposes changes to Personal Income Taxes",
        "date": "April 3, 2023",
        "content": "English version below\n\n07 Marzo de 2023\n\nResumen\n\nY el Impuesto de Asistencia Con motivo de la rendición de cuentas del Gobierno en Uruguay, del pasado 2 de marzo 2023, se anunciaron una serie de medidas tendientes a disminuir la carga fiscal del Impuesto a las Rentas de las Personas Físicas (IRPF)  a la Seguridad Social (IASS), las cuales están comprendidas en un Proyecto de Ley que se encuentra a estudio en el Parlamento.\n\nEn detalle\n\nEl pasado 2 de marzo, el Poder Ejecutivo presentó ante la Asamblea General un Proyecto de Ley en el cual expresa su intención de brindar “alivio tributario a ciertos contribuyentes” del Impuesto a las Rentas de las Personas Físicas (IRPF) y el Impuesto de Asistencia a la Seguridad Social (IASS).\n\nSin perjuicio que dicho proyecto de ley aún no ha sido aprobado, compartimos a continuación un resumen de los cambios propuestos en materia del IRPF:\n\n1) Se aumenta la deducción admitida en IRPF por cada hijo a cargo, pasando de ser 13 BPC (aproximadamente USD 1.840 por año por hijo) a 20 BPC (aproximadamente USD 2.830 por año por hijo). Se mantiene su duplicación en caso de hijos con discapacidad.\n\n2) Actualmente los contribuyentes podrán deducir en su liquidación del IRPF los montos pagados en el año por cuotas de préstamos hipotecarios, con el Banco Hipotecario del Uruguay o la Agencia Nacional de Vivienda, destinados a la adquisición de la vivienda única y permanente del contribuyente, siempre que el costo de la vivienda no supere cierto límite. Con el proyecto\nde ley analizado, se aumenta el límite máximo del costo por vivienda única y permanente para permitir hacer uso de la deducción del crédito\n\nhipotecario, pasando dicho tope de UI 794.000 (aproximadamente USD 112.620) a UI 1.000.000 (aproximadamente USD 141.840), manteniendo el tope de deducción anual en 36 BPC (aproximadamente USD 5.094 por año).\n\n3) Se aumenta la tasa de deducciones admitidas, de un 10% al 14% para el caso de los contribuyentes cuyos ingresos anuales sean iguales o inferiores a 180 BPC (aproximadamente USD 25.470 anuales o USD 2.120 mensuales). Con relación a este punto, cabe recordar que el IRPF en Uruguay no permite la deducción directa de los diferentes ítems previstos por la normativa, sino que\nsolamente se deduce una porción de estos. Es así como, por ejemplo, una persona puede quedar sujeta a una tasa de 30% de IRPF, pero sus deducciones admitidas pueden solamente considerarse en un 8%. Con el cambio propuesto, se aumenta el porcentaje de deducción para los tramos de menores ingresos.\n\n4) Por otro lado, se prevé aumentar el crédito por arrendamiento de inmuebles, actualmente fijado en un 6% anual, hacia el 8% anual. Los requisitos para acceder a este crédito permanecerían sin cambios.\n\nPor su parte, con relación al IASS, el proyecto de ley prevé aumentar el mínimo no imponible, del valor actual fijado en 96 BPC (aproximadamente USD 13.580\nanuales), hacia un nuevo monto de 108 BPC (aproximadamente USD 15.280 anuales).\n\nSin perjuicio que aún se trata de un Proyecto de Ley, una vez sea aprobado, se prevé que estos cambios sean aplicables para hechos generadores acaecidos a partir del 31 de diciembre 2023 inclusive.\n\n¿Cómo podemos ayudar?\n\nNuestro equipo de Vialto Partners está a su disposición para asesorar a nuestros clientes en los efectos prácticos de estos cambios propuestos, así como para asistirlo en la preparación de su declaración anual de IRPF o de\nIASS, en caso de que lo requiera.\n\nContáctenos\n\nPara cualquier consulta por este u otros temas relativos a Uruguay, por favor no dude en contactar a Vialto Partners:\n\n● Antonieta Rodríguez Mosquera, Senior Manager | antonieta.mosquera@vialto.com\n\nPuede encontrar más información de Vialto Partners en el siguiente enlace: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nSummary\n\nThe Uruguayan government announced in the yearly accountability meeting, on March 2nd, 2023, some changes to reduce the tax burden of Personal Resident’s Income Tax (hereby “IRPF” as per its Spanish acronym) and the Retirement’s Tax (hereby “IASS” as per its Spanish acronym), which have been included in a proposed bill of law, currently under study of the congress.\n\nIn detail\n\nOn March 2nd, the Executive Power filed to the Congress a proposed Bill of Law, which intends to provide tax relief to certain taxpayers of Personal Resident’s Income Tax(IRPF) and the Retirement’s Tax (IASS).Even though this is not yet an approved bill of law, we share below a summary of the main changes regarding the IRPF:\n\n1) The deduction allowed for each child, is increased from 13 BPC (approximately USD 1.840 per year per son/daughter) to 20 BPC (approximately USD 2.830 per year per son/daughter). It will still be possible to take twice this deduction in case of a child with disabilities.\n\n2) Currently, legislation allows for a deduction in IRPF calculation regarding the amounts paid in mortgage loans with the “Banco Hipotecario del Uruguay” or the “Agencia Nacional de Vivienda”, assuming the loan is destined to the effective acquisition of the home of the individual, which must be of permanent nature, and it has to be one sole real. This deduction is only applicable where the acquisition cost of the property does not exceed a specific amount. With this proposed bill of law, this specific acquisition cost amount is increased from UI 794.000 (approximately USD 112.620) to UI 1.000.000 (approximately USD 141.840). Where the requisites are met, the amount of the deduction remains unchanged in the annual amount of 36 BPC (approximately USD 5.094 per year).\n\n3) The tax deduction rate is increased from 10% to 14% for taxpayers whose annual income is equalor lower than 180 BPC (approximately USD 25.470 annually or USD 2.120 monthly). It should be noted that in Uruguay, the IRPF calculation does not allow for direct deduction of the items established in the legislation, but rather, each deduction is only considered in a specific percentage, established by the legislation. In practice, for example, an individual can have the income subject to a 30% tax rate, but his/her deductions can be considered only at an 8%. With the proposed change to the legislation, the deduction percentage is increased only for taxpayers in the lower brackets of the tax.\n\n4) On the other hand, the tax refund available for annual rental payments performed, is increased from 6% to 8%. All requisites to obtain this tax refund remain unchanged. Regarding IASS, the Bill of Law establishes an increase in the Non-Taxable Amount of this tax, currently fixed in 96 BPC (approximately USD 13.580 annually), to 108 BPC (approximately USD 15.280 annually). Assuming this Bill of Law is passed by the Congress, changes are expected to be in force for tax events occurred since December 31st, 2023, inclusive.\n\nHow we can help\n\nThe Vialto Partners team is entirely at disposal to assist the clients with regards to the practical impacts of the changes, as well as assist on the elaboration of the Uruguayan Individuals Tax Returns, either regarding IRPF or IASS\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, or any other query regarding Uruguay, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n● Antonieta Rodríguez Mosquera, Senior Manager |antonieta.mosquera@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "November 3, 2023",
        "content": "03 November 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nFrom 25 November 2023, the eligibility requirements for the Employer Nomination Scheme (ENS) subclass 186 visa will be simplified to allow a wider cohort of Temporary Skill Shortage (TSS) visa holders to apply for permanent residence. The onshore renewal restriction for Short-Term TSS visa holders applying for a third TSS visa will also be removed from this date.\n\nThe Detail\n\nIn April this year, the Minister for Home Affairs announced that a simpler and clearer pathway to permanent residence would be introduced for all TSS visa holders by the end of 2023. The Department of Home Affairs has now confirmed that, from 25 November 2023, changes will made to the Temporary Residence Transition (TRT) stream of the ENS and Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme (RSMS) which will expand eligibility to a wider cohort of TSS visa holders, as well as simplifying the eligibility criteria as follows:\n\n● Expanding PR eligibility to all streams of TSS visas (including Short-term and Labour Agreement streams).\n● Removing the requirement for nominated occupations in the TRT stream to be assessed against a skilled migration occupation list. The nominated occupation will need to be listed in the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO) and the nominated worker will need to continue to work in the occupation nominated for their TSS visa(s).\n● Reducing the qualifying employment and visa period that a TSS visa holder must hold their visa and work in their nominated position or occupation to 2 out of the 3 years before nomination.\n● Updating age exemptions for high income earning applicants and regional medical practitioner applicants aged 45 years and over to allow for a two-year pathway.\n\nThese changes will apply to all new ENS and RSMS nomination and visa applications lodged on or after 25 November 2023, as well as applications that are pending as at this date.\n\nRemoval of onshore renewal restriction for certain Short-term TSS visa holders\n\nAlso with effect from 25 November 2023, the onshore renewal restriction will be removed for TSS Short-term stream visa holders who are seeking to lodge a third TSS visa from within Australia. Importantly, any TSS Short-term stream visa holder who will expire prior to 25 November 2023, will continue to need to travel outside of Australia to lodge a third Short-Term stream TSS visa.\n\nFor a deeper discussion about the these changes and how they may be able to benefit your business, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nContact us\n\nStacey Tsui\nPartner & Principal Solicitor\nstacey.tsui@vialto.com\n\nCherie Wright\nPartner\ncherie.wright@vialto.com\n\nAnnalisa Symons\nDirector\nannalisa.symons@vialto.com\n\nRachel Williamson\nDirector\nrachel.williamson@vialto.com\n\nFariha.Islam\nDirector\nfariha.islam@vialto.com\n\nJohn O’Brien\nDirector\njohn.d.obrien@vialto.com\n\nArathi Tekkam\nDirector\narathi.tekkam@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com",

        "date": "December 17, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nThe New Zealand Government has announced significant reforms to the Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) system to better address skill shortages and streamline processes for employers. These include:\n\nThe changes will roll out in four stages throughout 2025, beginning in January. Additionally, Immigration New Zealand (INZ) is re-designing the Job Check step to improve processing for low-risk employers. The new Job Check process will be implemented from July 2025.\n\nThe detail\n\nFor accredited employers recruiting mainly at ANZSCO Skill Level 1 to 3 roles, the most significant upfront change will be the removal of the requirement to complete Employment New Zealand’s online modules and extended work rights for migrant employees on interim visas. Many will also look forward to what the new Job Check process will entail.\n\nWhile the removal of the median wage as a proxy for skills is welcome news for many, it is important to note that employers must still offer market rates relevant to the role and location. Further details on how a market rate will be referenced and applied are expected in March 2025.\n\nBy preparing for these changes, employers can adjust recruitment strategies and ensure compliance with updated visa requirements.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nJaq Chong\nDirector, Immigration\n\nKim Gibbs\nManager, Immigration\n\n\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "title": "Canada | CRA update regarding the proposed legislation affecting capital gains and stock options",
        "date": "February 7, 2025",
        "content": "Global Mobility Tax\n\n****La version française suit la version anglaise****\n\nSummary\n\nFurther to the Vialto Partners regional alert published on January 10, 2025, the Department of Finance announced on January 31, 2025, that it would be deferring the effective date of the proposed rules to January 1, 2026. CRA also announced that in accordance with this deferral, they would no longer be administering the proposed capital gains changes for the 2024 and 2025 calendar year. Although the announcement does not specifically address the stock option deduction, the originally proposed changes provided a combined threshold for capital gains and stock option income that may benefit from preferential tax treatment. As a result, we expect the deferral of the proposed changes to January 1, 2026 to apply to the stock option deduction as well.\n\nThis will provide certainty to employers in terms of withholding rates for 2024 and 2025, but does leave some open questions on 2024 T4 reporting of stock option deductions given CRA’s previously issued guidance. The change should be welcome for impacted employees, albeit there may be some individuals who accelerated gains and tax payments in anticipation of the proposed rules being applicable to 2024, who otherwise may not have done so.\n\nThe detail\n\nThe CRA has not commented explicitly on the withholding rate that should be applied to stock options, but based on the clear statement that the CRA will now administer the current enacted legislation, it would be reasonable to revert to the 50% deduction in calculating the withholding tax on eligible stock options until at least January 1, 2026.\n\nFor any employers who during 2024 have withheld tax at the 50% inclusion rate, there should no longer be a concern that they have an exposure to under-remittance penalties being charged by the CRA. For any employers who withheld tax at the higher inclusion rate during 2024, there is no action needed as the additional withholding would be credited against the employee liability on their tax return, and the employee will receive a credit for any additional tax withheld.\n\nIn the case of any 2025 tax withheld at the higher inclusion rate, it may be possible for employers to adjust for this by reducing the withholding rate on other compensation.\n\nAs employer taxes such as Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Employer Health Tax (EHT) are not impacted by the stock option deduction, there should be no need for changes to those returns.\n\nTo date there has been no guidance on how this impacts the previously announced changes to the T4 reporting for options exercised on or after June 25, 2024. To recap, the new reporting guidance issued by CRA was:\n\nSince the proposed changes have been deferred, the new box 90 and 91 should no longer be relevant. However, it is unclear whether employers who have already filed T4 slips with boxes 90 and 91 should amend the T4 slips, or if an adjustment will need to be made on the employee’s tax return to account for the correct stock option deduction.\n\nThe CRA indicates they “will issue forms that have been reverted to the currently enacted rate in the coming weeks.” Ideally, the CRA will also revert to the old T4 reporting of stock option benefits, prior to the February 28 T4 filing deadline.  Absent corrected T4 slips, employees may be at risk of incorrectly reporting their stock option deduction.   We are hopeful that further guidance on this will be forthcoming, as the T4 reporting is based on CRA guidance, which is administrative and not legislative.\n\nOn February 5, 2025, Finances Quebec announced the intention for Quebec to harmonize the Quebec tax system with the deferral of the implementation of change to capital gains inclusion rate to January 1, 2026.\n\nThis deferral means that employees eligible for a 50% deduction on their capital gains and stock options will not have the deduction restricted to the first $250,000 of such income realized on or after June 25, 2024. While this will result in lower tax liabilities for impacted employees, this may still be a frustrating situation for taxpayers who accelerated gains that they otherwise wouldn’t have on the assumption that the $250,000 rule would be an ongoing annual threshold.\n\nThe CRA has also indicated that penalty and interest relief up to June 2, 2025 will be available to impacted employees who may not be able to file their tax returns on or before the due date of April 30, 2025. It is not clear in what circumstances this relief would apply, but could be intended to reflect a situation where there was an ongoing administrative barrier to completing a tax return.\n\nIt should be noted that the government has not abandoned the proposed rules, rather it has deferred the implementation date to January 1, 2026. This new effective date would largely be dependent on the current government winning the forthcoming general election.\n\nWhile the deferral of the effective date has impacts for employees and employers, it should be noted that this will also provide some degree of certainty to companies and trusts that were also impacted by the proposed rules.\n\nDepartment of Finance announcement\n\nCRA announcement\n\nFinances Quebec\n\n\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nChelsea Coosemans\nPartner, Toronto\n\nDan Trinh\nPartner, Vancouver\n\nJesse Forand\nPartner, Montreal\n\nAlex Legg\nDirector, Calgary\n\nTheo Ciju\nDirector, Toronto\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.

All Rights Reserved.\n\n\n\nVERSION FRANÇAISE\n\nFiscalité – Mobilité internationale\n\nRésumé\n\nSuite à l’alerte régionale de Vialto Partners publiée le 10 janvier 2025, le ministère des Finances et l’ARC a confirmé dans un communiqué de presse le 31 janvier 2025, qu’en accord avec le changement de politique gouvernementale visant à reporter la date d’entrée en vigueur des règles proposées au 1er janvier 2026, il n’appliquera plus les changements proposés concernant les gains en capital pour les années civiles 2024 et 2025. Bien que le communiqué de presse ne traite pas spécifiquement de la déduction pour options d’achat de titres accordés à des employés, les changements initialement proposés prévoyaient un calcul harmonisé pour les gains en capital et les revenus d’options d’achat d’actions qui pourraient bénéficier d’un traitement fiscal préférentiel. En conséquence, nous nous attendons à ce que le report des changements proposés au 1er janvier 2026 s’applique également à la déduction pour options d’achat d’actions.\n\nCela apportera une certaine clarté aux employeurs en ce qui concerne les taux de retenue d’impôt pour 2024 et 2025, mais laisse certaines questions en suspens sur les feuillets T4 de 2024 concernant la déduction  pour options d’achat d’actions, compte tenu des directives précédemment émises par l’ARC. Ce changement devrait être bien accueilli par les employés concernés, bien qu’il puisse y avoir des individus qui ont accéléré les gains et les paiements d’impôts en prévision de l’application des règles proposées à 2024, ce qu’ils n’auraient pas fait autrement.\n\nEn détails\n\nL’ARC n’a pas fait de commentaires explicitement sur le taux de retenue qui devrait être appliqué aux options d’achat d’actions, mais sur la base de la déclaration claire à l’effet que l’ARC administrera désormais la législation actuellement en vigueur, il serait raisonnable de rétablir la déduction de 50 % dans le calcul de l’impôt retenu sur les options d’achat d’actions éligibles, du moins jusqu’au 1er janvier 2026.\n\nPour tout employeur qui, durant 2024, a retenu un impôt au taux d’inclusion de 50 %, il ne devrait plus y avoir de préoccupation quant à un risque de pénalités pour retenue insuffisante imposées par l’ARC. Pour tout employeur qui a retenu un impôt au taux d’inclusion plus élevé durant 2024, aucune action n’est nécessaire, car la retenue supplémentaire sera créditée contre la charge d’impôt de l’employé sur sa déclaration de revenus.\n\nDans le cas de toute retenue d’impôt en 2025 au taux d’inclusion plus élevé, il pourrait être possible pour les employeurs d’ajuster en réduisant le taux de retenue sur d’autres compensations.\n\nQuant aux parts employeur des cotisations telles que le Régime de pensions du Canada (RPC) et l’Impôt-santé des employeurs (ISE), elles ne sont pas affectés par la déduction des options d’achat d’actions, il ne devrait pas y avoir besoin de modifications à ces déclarations.\n\nÀ ce jour, il n’y a pas eu de directives sur les changements précédemment annoncés concernant le feuillet T4 pour les options exercées après le 24 juin 2024. Pour récapituler, les nouvelles directives relatives aux feuillets T4 émises par l’ARC étaient :\n\nÉtant donné que les changements proposés ont été reportés, les nouvelles cases 90 et 91 ne devraient plus être pertinentes. Cependant, il n’est pas clair si les employeurs qui ont déjà déposé des feuillets T4 avec les cases 90 et 91 devraient modifier les feuillets T4, ou si un ajustement devra être effectué sur la déclaration de revenus de l’employé pour tenir compte de la déduction correcte des options d’achat d’actions.\n\nL’ARC indique qu’elle émettra des formulaires qui ont été rétablis au taux actuellement en vigueur dans les semaines à venir. Idéalement, l’ARC reviendra également à l’ancien feuillet T4 pour les avantages liés aux options d’achat d’actions, avant la date limite de dépôt des T4 du 28 février. En l’absence de feuillets T4 corrigés, les employés pourraient risquer de déclarer incorrectement leur déduction pour options d’achat d’actions. Nous espérons que des directives supplémentaires à ce sujet seront bientôt disponibles, car le feuillet T4 est basé sur les directives de l’ARC, qui sont administratives et non législatives.\n\nLe 5 février 2025, Finances Québec a annoncé l’intention pour le Québec d’harmoniser le système fiscal québécois avec le report de la mise en œuvre du changement au taux d’inclusion des gains en capital au 1er janvier 2026.\n\nCe report signifie que les employés éligibles à une déduction de 50 % sur leurs gains en capital et options d’achat d’actions ne verront pas la déduction limitée aux premiers 250 000 $ de ces revenus réalisés le 25 juin 2024 ou après. Bien que cela entraîne une charge fiscale plus faible pour les employés concernés, cela peut encore être une situation frustrante pour les contribuables qui ont accéléré des gains qu’ils n’auraient pas autrement réalisés en supposant que la règle des 250 000 $ serait un seuil annuel récurrant.\n\nL’ARC a également indiqué qu’un allègement des pénalités et des intérêts jusqu’au 2 juin 2025 sera disponible pour les employés concernés qui pourraient ne pas être en mesure de déposer leur déclaration de revenus à la date limite du 30 avril 2025. Il n’est pas clair dans quelles circonstances cet allègement s’appliquerait, mais il pourrait être destiné à refléter une situation où il y avait un obstacle administratif continu à la production d’une déclaration de revenus.\n\nIl convient de noter que le gouvernement n’a pas abandonné les règles proposées, mais a plutôt reporté la date de mise en œuvre au 1er janvier 2026. Cette nouvelle date d’entrée en vigueur dépendra en grande partie de la victoire du gouvernement actuel lors des prochaines élections générales.\n\nBien que le report de la date d’entrée en vigueur ait des impacts pour les employés et les employeurs, il convient de noter que cela fournira également un certain degré de certitude aux entreprises et aux fiducies qui ont également été impactées par les règles proposées.\n\nAnnonce du ministère des Finances\n\nAnnonce de l’ARC\n\nFinances Quebec\n\n\n\nContactez-nous\n\nPour une discussion plus approfondie sur ce qui précède, veuillez contacter votre interlocuteur chez Vialto Partners, ou alternativement:\n\nJesse Forand\nAssocié, Montréal\n\nDe plus amples informations sur Vialto Partners sont disponibles ici: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners et/ou Vialto Associés (« Vialto ») fait référence aux filiales détenues en propriété exclusive de CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited ainsi qu’aux autres membres du réseau mondial Vialto Partners.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nUnited States | Second random selection from previously submitted registrations completed for FY 2025 H-1B regular cap\n\nSummary\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) previously announced that they had identified a need to select additional registrations for unique beneficiaries to reach the fiscal year (FY) 2025 regular cap numerical allocation. On August 5, 2024, USCIS announced that a sufficient number of registrations have been randomly selected to reach the regular cap from the remaining properly submitted FY 2025 registrations. All prospective petitioners with selected registrations from this round have been notified.\n\nThe Detail\n\nThe initial registration period for the fiscal year (FY) 2025 H-1B cap opened on March 6, 2024, and ran through March 25, 2024. During this period, prospective petitioners and their representatives, if applicable, used a USCIS online account to register eligible beneficiaries electronically forthe H-1B Cap Registrations selection process. Only those selected registrations were eligible to file H-1B cap-subject petitions during the filing period between April 1 through June 30, 2024 (July 1, 2024 for paper filings).\n\nOn July 30, 2024, USCIS previously announced that they had identified a need to select additional registrations to reach the FY 2025 regular cap numerical allocation. The second round of selections randomly drew from previously submitted electronic submissions and USCIS would notify prospective petitioners with selected registrations that they are eligible to file an H-1B cap-subject petition for a named beneficiary.\n\nOn August 5, 2024, USCIS announced that a sufficient number of registrations have been randomly selected to reach the regular cap from the remaining properly submitted FY 2025 registrations.

The proposed law aligns with the Ministry of Labour’s strategy to boost the number of Qatari nationals employed in the private sector.\n\nThe Detail\nThe Ministry of Labour has highlighted the key features of a new law to nationalise jobs in the private sector. The new law, aligned with Qatar National Vision 2030, aims to boost development by investing in skills and creating jobs and training opportunities for citizens. It supports the Ministry’s strategy to increase the involvement of local workforce in private companies, open job opportunities within the National Manpower Affairs Program, and maximise the use of qualified nationals. The law seeks to make the job market more appealing to local nationals, help companies attract citizens and promote Qatari participation in the private sectors.\n\nAdditionally, the Ministry has the authority to provide incentives, facilities, and privileges, including supporting citizens in completing university studies for private sector positions.\n\nThe law specifically applies to Qatari men and women in leadership and specialised roles, and it also focuses on training locals for leadership positions in the private sector.\n\nWhat this means\nWith the implementation of the new law, the Ministry of Labour will allocate certain leadership and specialised roles to citizens within the private sector and it is important to understand how to apply these changes in line with the Government legislation. We await information in relation to the exact roles that will be subject to nationalisation, and whether or not any quotas or percentage rates will apply, similar to other nationalisation programmes in the GCC.\n\nHow we can help\nWe will continue to closely monitor and provide timely guidance on any new updates announced by the Ministry of Labour and the Shura Council highlighting the impact of any changes that may follow.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnir Chatterji\nEMEA Immigration Partner\n\nRekha Simpson\nDirector, Middle East Immigration\n\nMarilyn Serrao\nSenior Associate, Middle East Immigration\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit: www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nContact us on the following address: me-immigration@vialto.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Social Security\n\nColombia | Minimum salary increase for 2024\n\nSummary\nAs of January 1, 2024, the Colombian Ministry of Labor increased monthly minimum salary and legal transportation aid for jobs in the private sector.

This increase also impacts the minimum integrated salary and social security contribution maximum base.\n\n*Monthly legal transportation aid: It applies to employees earning up to 2 monthly minimum salaries.\n\n** Integrated salary: An integrated salary (salario integral) refers to a compensation package that includes not only the base salary but also various additional components, such as social legal benefits, bonuses, overtime, nighttime, Sundays, and holidays work.

        "title": "Austria | Tax | Interaction between commuter allowance and public transport ticket",
        "date": "January 25, 2023",
        "content": "18 January 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nAs of 1 January 2023, there are changes in how the Austrian commuter allowance interacts with the full or partial reimbursement of the costs of a public transport ticket by an employer.\n\nThe Detail\n\nThe Tax Amendment Act 2022 (AbgÄG 2022) brought about, among other things, a change in the method of calculating the amount of the commuter allowance for cases in which the employer provides the employee with a public transport ticket free of charge or reimburses a part of the cost of a transportation ticket (weekly, monthly or annual ticket). As of 1 January 2023, the commuter allowance will be calculated differently, as outlined below.\n\nLegal situation until 31 December 2022\nIf the employer bore the costs (or partial costs) of a public transport ticket (weekly, monthly or annual) for the majority of the time during the payroll period, the employee could not claim a commuter allowance or a commuter euro for the distance covered by the public transport ticket. Commuter allowance and commuter euro could only be claimed for an additional part of the route that was not covered by the public transport ticket.\n\nExample\n• An employer provided his employee living in Lower Austria with the annual ticket for the core zone of Vienna (€ 365 per year)\n• home to employee’s place of work: 70 km\n• home to the Vienna core zone border: 60 km\n• The employee commuted for 13 days a month\n\nUnder the previous legal situation, for the distance not covered by the public transport ticket (home – Vienna core zone border, 60 km), the employee could claim the large commuter allowance (assuming the use of a means of mass transportation such as a train/bus etc is not reasonable) in the amount of € 214.00 per month as well as the commuter euro of € 10.00 (60 km) per month.\n\nLegal situation as of 1 January 2023\nIn a first step, the commuter allowance is to be calculated as if the employer does not bear any of the employee’s transportation costs. Using the commuter calculator (provided by the Federal Ministry of\nFinance), the commuter allowance for the distance between home and their place of work has to be determined. From the calculated commuter allowance, the amount granted by the employer for the public transport ticket is now to be deducted. The employee can then claim the commuter allowance in respect of the remaining amount.\n\nThe commuter euro, however, can be claimed for the entire distance between the employee’s home and place of work. Even in the cases in which the commuter allowance is zero due to the deduction of the costs borne by the employer, the employee still has an entitlement to the commuter euro.\n\nIn case the employer (partially) reimburses the costs of a ticket valid for more than one month, the reimbursement shall be apportioned evenly over the entire period of validity of the weekly, monthly or annual ticket.\n\nExample\n• An employer provides their employee living in Lower Austria with the annual ticket for the core zone of Vienna (€ 365 per year)\n• home to employee’s place of work: 70 km\n• home to the Vienna core zone border: 60 km\n• The employee commutes for 13 days a month\n\nUnder the legal situation applicable as of 1 January 2023, the commuter allowance shall be calculated (with the help of the commuter calculator) for the entire distance from their home to their place of work (70 km). This results in a large commuter allowance (assuming, as before, that the use of a means of mass transport is not reasonable) in the amount of € 306 per month. The costs borne by the employer are to be deducted from the amount calculated. Therefore, the costs of the annual ticket for the core zone of Vienna borne by the employer (€ 365. per year) are to be apportioned evenly over the months of its validity (12 months).\n\nA commuter allowance can now be claimed in the amount of € 275.58.\n€ 306 – (€ 365 / 12 month) = € 275,58\nThe commuter euro is due in the full amount for 70 km (€ 11.67)\n\nThe examples are based on the values of the commuter allowance and the commuter euro without the\ntemporary increase (from May 2022 to June 2023).\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n• Elke Preßl, Manager | elke.pressl@vialto.com\n• Petra Demel, Manager | petra.v.demel@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Malaysia | Immigration | Enhancement of Projection Application Process under ESD",
        "date": "April 6, 2023",
        "content": "4 April 2023\n\nImpact: Medium\n\nSummary\n\nReferring to the latest announcement by the Expatriate Services Division (ESD) of the Immigration Department of Malaysia, effective 1 April 2023, the projection application process under the ESD is enhanced and simplified where minimal information is required for the submission of the projection application to the Immigration authority.\n\nPrior to this, companies were required to provide very detailed information of the expatriates requiring the projection such as, among others, name, passport number, nationality, job title, salary and job description, in order to justify the projection application.\n\nCompanies under the purview of ESD that submitted any projection application prior to 1 April 2023 and yet to receive an outcome to this date must resubmit their projection application to the Immigration authority under the new enhanced system in the ESD portal.\n\nThe Detail\n\nBefore companies can submit a work pass application i.e. Employment Pass (EP) or Professional Visit Pass (PVP) to ESD, they are required to have the necessary projection number approved by the Immigration authority. Companies requiring projections for the coming year must submit their annual EP and PVP projection applications at the end of every year. Any unutilised projections for a particular year will be forfeited at the end of the year and will not be carried forward to the next year. Should companies require any additional projections throughout the year, an additional application to the Immigration authority can be submitted.\n\nWith this latest announcement, companies are no longer required to furnish detailed information of the expatriates requiring the projection in order to justify the projection application to the Immigration authority. Only minimal information such as the number of projections, category of positions and total number of employees (Malaysians and non-Malaysians) must be furnished in the projection application submission. Additional supporting documents which were previously required for projection applications e.g. justification letter, job descriptions and contracts or letters of award are now no longer required to be submitted.\n\nThe processing time for the projection application is also now significantly reduced whereby approval is instantly obtained after submission of the projection application to the Immigration authority.\n\nThis enhancement of process applies to both EP and PVP projection.\n\nThe projection application process for companies under the purview of the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) remains unchanged.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThis new simplified process for projection applications under ESD is a welcome enhancement by the Immigration authority as it eliminates the requirement for companies to furnish detailed information for the projection application. This previous requirement was a challenge to companies as the extensive details were usually not available to the companies at the time of applying for projections, which is usually applied a few months ahead of identifying and/or hiring expatriates for specific roles in Malaysia. Companies which could not provide these details to the Immigration authority during the projection application were usually not granted approval of their projection application. This impacted the companies’ workforce management such as, among others, their hiring process and employees’ assignment start dates.\n\nWith this new enhancement, it will be easier for companies to obtain and justify the projection numbers necessary to accommodate their business needs in Malaysia. While approval of the projection application is instantly obtained after submission of the projection application, companies are advised to strategise their workforce management ahead of time and take into consideration the projection process into the overall timeline\n\nHow we can help\n\nOur team is able to assist you in understanding the projection application requirements in greater detail and applying for your projection applications. In the meantime, our team is closely monitoring the implementation of this new enhanced system in ESD and we will provide you with the relevant updates from time to time.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

Combined with USC band changes, this will result in a reduction in tax in excess of €400 for those on incomes over €70,044. For employers, there was welcome news that the Small Benefit Exemption limit will be increased to €1,500 per year, with up to five non cash benefits now being allowed.\n\nThere was no mention of extensions to the Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP) or the Foreign Earnings Deduction (FED), both of which are due to cease at the end of the 2025 tax year.

        "title": "UAE | Immigration | Unemployment Insurance scheme",
        "date": "January 24, 2023",
        "content": "24 January 2023\n\nImpact Medium\n\nSummary\n\nThe UAE government has announced a new requirement for employees in the private and government sectors to register with an unemployment insurance scheme starting from 1 January 2023, called the Involuntary Loss of Employment (ILOE). This scheme provides Emirati nationals as well as UAE residents financial support in case of redundancy or contract termination from the employer. The new legislation aims to ensure continued sustainable living for the unemployed and help the country retain a competitive knowledge economy while attracting the best international talent.\n\nThe Detail\n\nThe Involuntary Loss of Employment (ILOE) is an unemployment insurance scheme that provides UAE nationals and residents working in the federal and private sectors financial support should they be made redundant from their job, as a result of termination by their employer. The financial support will be valued and paid in exchange of a monthly insurance premium from the employee during their employment tenure.\n\nThe scope of the scheme applies to all workers in the private and federal sectors, however the following categories are exempted:\n\n– Employees of companies incorporated in Freezones*;\n– Investors, business owners who own and manage their business themselves;\n– Domestic workers;\n– Employees hired on a temporary basis;\n– Juveniles under the age of 18;\n– Retirees who receive a pension and have joined a new employer.\n\n*Although Freezone based employees are not eligible (yet), and will not be able to apply (at the time of publication) the authorities are working on a wider rollout.\n\nUnder the ILOE scheme, the employee must fulfill the monthly insurance payments for at least 12 months in order to qualify for financial support for a period of no more than three months from the date of termination. The compensation will be calculated on 60% of the employee’s total monthly salary, and will be capped at AED 10,000 for employees earning less than AED 16,000 per month, and AED 20,000 for employees earning more than AED 16,000 per month. The insurance scheme and its benefits will cease from the date the employee secures new employment in the UAE or three months from the date of redundancy/termination. Employees who resign from their employment or those terminated for disciplinary reasons will not be eligible to benefit from the scheme.\n\nWhat this means\n\nEmployees must sign up for the Involuntary Loss of Employment scheme (ILOE) starting from 1 January 2023. There are a number of selected insurance providers in the UAE to register under the scheme; it is recommended to use the official website iloe.ae. The deadline to register under the scheme is 30 June 2023, and failing to register will result in a fine of AED 400 per employee. Employers are not obliged to enroll their employees in the insurance scheme or pay any contributions to the scheme. The ILOE is employee specific and the employee is primarily responsible for subscribing to the scheme, although employers are encouraged to emphasise the importance since it concerns an important development related to employees’ labour protection.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe will continue to closely monitor and provide timely guidance on any new updates by the UAE immigration authorities, and highlight the impact of any changes that may impact your expatriate workforce.\n\nContact us\n\nShould you have further questions on this update, please reach out to:\n\n● Anir Chatterji – Partner, EMEA Immigration: anir.chatterji@vialto.com\n● Rekha Simpson – Director, Middle East Immigration: rekha.simpson@vialto.com\n● Dounia Fathi-Benbrahim – Senior Manager, Middle East Immigration: dounia.fathi-benbrahim@vialto.com\n● Ananth Prasad – Manager, Middle East Immigration: ananth.prasad@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

Many companies are following suit with some big names recently instructing their staff to return to the office for 3+ days per week. Often, such employer policies do not take into account the special circumstances of the employee population that lives abroad – or perhaps even more risky, they do!\n\nIn terms of global social security, the concept of hybrid working is not necessarily supported by international legal frameworks.

        "date": "March 27, 2025",
        "content": "Global Mobility Tax\n\nSummary\n\nThe Philippine Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) is now strictly implementing Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 87-2024 in relation to the electronic filing of tax returns in the Philippines.\n\nAs such, the BIR now requires, aside from the electronic filing of Annual Income Tax Returns (AITRs) through eBIRForms Package Platform, the electronic submission of the attachments thereto via the electronic Audited Financial Statements (eAFS) System or electronic Submission Facility, whichever is applicable.\n\nWhile the actual filing due date of AITRs remains to be April 15th, taxpayers are given 15 days to submit the relevant attachments, i.e., until April 30th. Given this time sensitive process, taxpayers are urged to register with the eAFS/eSubmission facility as soon as possible in order to fully comply with their tax obligations.\n\nThe detail\n\nBackground\n\nAITRs for individuals are currently required to be prepared and lodged electronically through the eBIRForms Package platform. However, the attachments to AITRs with “nil” filing were historically printed and physically brought to the Revenue District Offices (RDOs) in order for the related attachments to be manually filed and accordingly, stamped “received” by the BIR. However, in our recent experience and as officially relayed to us, the BIR shall no longer accept the manual submission of AITRs and related attachments.\n\nThis follows the mandate for taxpayers to utilize digital platforms in submitting the AITRs attachments, i.e., eBIR Form / eSubmission facility, based on the earlier RMC No. 87-2024 relative to the manner of filing of tax returns and payment of taxes.\n\nAs the only exception to the rule, manual submission of attachments are allowed when the eAFS system/eSubmission facility is unavailable (as will be announced by the BIR). In which case, the attachments to the AITRs may be submitted manually.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThis entails taxpayers to urgently register with the eAFS System / eSubmission Facility.\n\nRisks of Non-Compliance\n\nKindly note that in case the taxpayer will not be able to electronically submit the required AITRs attachments through eAFS/eSubmission facility, the BIR may challenge the completeness of AITRs filing and may still deem the filing as void or non-compliant due to incomplete attachments; hence, may be subject to penalties.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nGeraldine C.

        "title": "Spain | Immigration |  Amendments to Spanish Special Immigration Act regarding entrepreneurs, digital nomads and highly skilled professionals",
        "date": "January 31, 2023",
        "content": "26 January 2023\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\nOn 1 December 2022, the Spanish Parliament approved the so-called “Law of Start-ups”, which includes significant reforms of the current immigration legal framework for digital nomads (previously unregulated but increasingly more common), highly skilled professionals and entrepreneurs.\n\nThe reforms aim to benefit targeted groups given their economic relevance, such as workers with disruptive skills, and innovative businesses; by relaxing administrative or bureaucratic requirements, adapting the legal framework to the post-pandemic “new-normal” and boost the efficiency of immigration procedures for this reference group.\n\nThese new changes came into effect by late December 2022, although the administrative practice has not been set up yet – this is due to happen before 31 March 2023.\n\nThe Detail\n\nUpcoming changes: what’s going to be new.\n\na) Implementation of a new visa and residence permit adhoc for digital nomads and remote workers: now, non-EU employees, hired by a foreign company (non-based in Spain), with an internal seniority within their employers of at least three months, can apply either for a digital nomad visa at the relevant Spanish Consulate abroad valid for one year (if the applicant is not initially present in Spain when submitting the application); or for a residence permit as a digital nomad directly in Spain, valid for three years. This is extendable to the digital nomad’s direct relatives too.\n\nIn regards to the foreign employer’s requirements, there are basically two: the company must have been an operating business for at least one year prior to the application; and the job to be developed in Spain shall be done fully remotely on behalf of the foreign employer, without providing professional services to a company based in Spain (under such a scenario, an ICT work permit would be more appropriate).\n\nAlternatively, if the digital nomad is a self-employed person, it is permitted that a maximum of 20% of the applicant’s labour time is dedicated to the provision of services to Spanish companies.\n\nb) Initial validity of work permits for highly skilled professionals, researchers, national intra-company work permits, investors and entrepreneurs (in addition to the digital nomads) of three years, rather than two.\n\nc) Easing of administrative requirements, such as:\n\nd) Redefinition, on the one hand, of what “entrepreneurial activity” means at the light of the Immigration Law (setting the focus on the applicant’s profile, his/her business plan and its added value for the Spanish economy); and, on the other hand, more importantly, reshaping of the process – which now is handled entirely by the central immigration office (“Dirección General de Migraciones”) and liaises with the relevant stakeholders (mainly, the Spanish Consulate and ENISA) during the visa and residence permit application process.\n\ne) Graduates: the visa for searching employment is valid now up to 24 months (rather than 12), whereas the work permit for graduates on the grounds of a trainee contract is now valid for up to 12 months.\n\n\n\nWhat this means for you\n\nThese changes will make some immigration processes more efficient by easing some requirements. It will also allow to accommodate new trends in regards to digital nomads and expat policies, so spread in the post-pandemic new-normal, making Spain an attractive base for this group of remote workers along with the also new tax incentives and  fiscal reforms to be implemented along with the immigration changes here announced.\n\nHow we can help\n\nPlease do reach out to your Vialto Partners contact should you have any questions on the above.

Presenting his findings to the newly elected House of Representatives, verkenner Ronald Plasterk advised the PVV, NSC, VVD and BBB parties to work together in a next phase towards forming a coalition. Having been verkenner, Ronald Plasterk has now also been nominated as informateur, where he will mediate talks between the 4 parties. These talks are expected to last until mid-February 2024.\n\nThe Detail\n\nOn 11 December 2023, the Dutch formation investigator, Ronald Plasterk, published his findings, following a consultation with all parties elected to the Dutch House of Representatives. In his report, Mr. Plasterk found that PVV, NSC, VVD and BBB would be most likely to be able to form a coalition with working majorities in both chambers of the Dutch parliament. These findings were debated in the House of Representatives on 13 December and, subsequently, a majority voted to approve the proposal to have PVV, NSC, VVD and BBB enter the next phase of negotiations. See our previous alert on the outcome of the Dutch general election for more information on the main parties and election results.\n\nWhat will happen next?\n\nWhen assenting to the proposed approach following the verkenning, the House of Representatives also approved the nomination of Ronald Plasterk as informateur. This means that Mr. Plasterk will mediate the next informing phase of the coalition talks between the four main parties.\n\nThis phase of the talks are anticipated to last until mid-February 2024, after which Mr. Plasterk will issue a new report. It is expected that talks will follow the general outline as specified in the verkenning report, which essentially covers two areas. Firstly, talks will initially cover the safeguarding of the Dutch Constitution, the Dutch fundamental rights, and the constitutional state of democracy. These points were raised by Pieter Omtzigt, leader of the NSC, who has expressed reservations about PVV’s commitment to upholding the Dutch Constitution in light of their stance on issues such as migration, religion and EU membership. Secondly, talks will focus on areas of agreement between the 4 parties on key issues from the manifestos of the main parties. The main topics include:\n\nDepending on the outcome of the informing phase of the negotiations, it is possible that subsequent talks will take place to form a government. In the meantime the talks between the 4 parties and Mr. Plasterk will take place behind closed doors.\n\nWhat does this mean for employers?\n\nUntil a new coalition has been formed, with agreed common policies in the areas mentioned above, no significant changes are expected in respect of corporate immigration legislation or policy. However, with the new members of the House of Representatives having been sworn in, it is possible that a new majority of PVV, VVD, NSC and BBB will already vote differently on certain issues than intended by Mark Rutte’s outgoing cabinet.\n\nContact us\n\nVialto will continue to monitor developments and the possible impact for businesses and employees.

Under this calculation method, the individual generally benefits from a tax savings as the equity incentive income will not be added to the regular income for tax calculation purposes and hence a lower tax rate could be applied.\n\nSince the implementation of the new IIT law in 2019, the IIT preferential policy has been extended several times. This policy extension is regarded as a significant support for the capital market and the promotion of innovation and company development through tax policies. It is welcomed by many companies and taxpayers and promotes the use of equity- based compensation.\n\nThe Takeaways\nThe extension of preferential tax policy on equity incentive income in China is expected to further solidify equity incentives as a popular compensation component for companies to incentivize their employees.

        "date": "July 19, 2023",
        "content": "18 July 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nThe Finance Bill 2023 was presented by the Federal Government in the National Assembly on June 9, 2023. After discussions in the Senate and National Assembly, the Government has passed the Finance Act 2023 (FA) with certain modifications and amendments to the Finance Bill.\n\nThe amendments made by the FA became effective from July 1, 2023. This document provides a summary of the significant aspects of the Act.\n\nThe Detail\n\nNew salary tax rates\n\nThe salary tax rates have been updated as follows:\n\nNew individual and AOP (Association of Persons) tax rates\n\nTaxation on Bonus Shares Reintroduced (Section 39, 236Z)\n\nIn the past, the definition of ‘income’ in section 2(29) excluded the face value of bonus shares for shareholders of a company. However, the Finance Act of 2014 introduced withholding provisions, implementing a separate ‘final tax’ on bonus shares issued by both listed and unlisted companies, while omitting the aforementioned exclusion from the income definition.\n\nThe FA reintroduces this tax measure by amending the definition of ‘income,’ expanding the scope of ‘income from other sources,’ and introducing a withholding tax provision, effective from July 1, 2023. The key features of the measures are as follows:\n\nAdvance Tax Inactive Taxpayer (Section 231AB)\n\nThe Federal Board of Revenue reintroduced adjustable advance tax on cash withdrawals by Inactive Tax Payers through an amendment. The tax rate is set at 0.6% when the cumulative amount of cash withdrawals in a single day exceeds Rs 50,000. This will have a considerable impact on those who do not file their tax returns in time.\n\nSuper Tax – Progressive rates on high-earning persons (Section 4C, 147)\n\nIn the Finance Act of 2022, the concept of Super Tax was introduced for high-earning persons, to be paid when filing their tax returns. Slab-wise (progressive) rates were established for the 2022 tax year, with a maximum rate of 4%. Certain specified sectors had an enhanced rate of 10% for the 2022 tax year only, while banking companies were subject to a 10% super tax for the 2023 tax year.\n\nThe Constitution Petitions were filed in various High Courts challenging the retrospective application of the super tax for the 2022 tax year and the enhanced rate for specified sectors. The High Court of Sindh ruled that the super tax was not applicable for the 2022 tax year, and the enhanced rate for specified sectors exceeding 4% was deemed discriminatory and ultra vires. This decision is currently under review by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Finance Bill of 2023 proposes new slab rates for super tax, targeting taxpayers with income exceeding Rs 300 million. The updated slab rates are as follows:\n\nAdvance Tax on Foreign Domestic Workers (Section 231C)\n\nA new provision for advance tax has been introduced for the employment of foreign nationals as domestic workers. Under this provision any authority issuing or renewing domestic aide visa to any foreign national as a domestic worker at the time of issuing or renewing such visa shall collect from the agency, sponsor or the person as the case may be, employing the services of such foreign national a tax of two hundred thousand rupees.\n\nThe tax collected or collectible under this section shall be adjustable advance tax for the tax year to which it relates on the income of such agency, sponsor or a person, as the case may be, employing the services of such foreign national.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Ireland | Employment Tax | Employment status for income tax purposes—New revenue guidance",
        "date": "May 22, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nIreland | Employment status for income tax purposes—New revenue guidance\n\nSummary\n\nOn 21 May 2024 the Irish Revenue Commissioners issued a new and comprehensive set of guidelines on the determination of employment status of workers for income tax purposes.\n\nThe guidelines (which are complex and run to 58 pages) set out a framework on which employers will in future be expected to base their determination as to whether a worker is employed or self-employed.\n\nThe guidance is based on the Supreme Court judgement in the recent landmark case of The Revenue Commissioners v Karshan (Midlands) Ltd. t/a Domino’s Pizza, which concerned the employment status of pizza delivery drivers. The Supreme court found that the delivery drivers in question were employees for income tax purposes.\n\nWe have considered the new guidelines and set out below our initial view on how they are likely to impact on employers.\n\nThe detail\n\nBackground\n\nTo date, Revenue has published a periodically updated “Code of Practice” on the determination of employment status, most recently in 2021. That document set out the various tests arising from relevant case law up to that point in assessing the status of a worker, along with other factors to be considered in arriving at an assessment.\n\nHowever, unlike the Code of Practice, the newly issued guidelines are based firmly on the recent findings of the Supreme Court and the framework set out by the court for the making of determinations, thereby making these more prescriptive and leaving less room for subjectivity. They also make clear that the guidelines extend to “Platform Workers” (i.e. those who find work through digital platforms) and to occasional or periodic “gigs” or “shifts” in what has become known as the “Gig Economy”.\n\nIt is intended that the existing Code of Practice will be updated shortly to take account of new guidelines.\n\nThe Framework\n\nThe framework set out by the Supreme Court is built around five criteria that it considered essential to the determination of employment status. While these are complex and were addressed at length by the court and by Revenue in the new guidelines, a brief overview of the criteria is set out below.\n\n* Note: The Supreme Court took the position that, if any of criteria 1 – 3 is answered in the negative, there cannot be a contract of employment. These, therefore, act as a filter before progressing to 4 and 5. Be aware, however, that it does not necessarily follow that an employment exists merely because 1 – 3 are all answered positively. Criteria 4 and 5 must then be considered.\n\nWhat the decision means for Employers\n\nRevenue has made its position clear in relation to the application of the guidelines – it states definitively that “A worker’s employment status for taxation purposes is not a matter of choice” and that “the [Supreme Court] judgement provides clarity on the determination of employment status of workers for taxation purposes”.\n\nIt can, therefore, be expected that Revenue will seek to rigorously enforce the new guidance. It can also be expected that Revenue’s default position will be that an employment is more likely to exist, other than where it can be clearly shown to the contrary.\n\nFurthermore, in terms of potential avenues of appeal against Revenue determinations of employed status, unless the facts of a case can be shown clearly to point to self-employed status having, regard to the Supreme Court framework, it is likely to be extremely difficult to overturn such determinations at the Tax Appeal Commissioners or in the Courts.\n\nOn a positive note, Revenue reconfirms in the guidance that “any engagement of companies by businesses cannot be contracts of service, or employments, for taxation purposes” i.e. there is no change in the tax position for businesses who engage companies to carry out work on their behalf.\n\nNext Steps\n\nEmployers who currently employ or who may be considering the engagement of contractors (or Contingent Workers) will need to consider the robustness of the arrangements they have or intend to put in place. If in doubt, professional advice is strongly recommended.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAoife Reid\nPartner\n\nClara Flynn\nDirector\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nNotes\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "United Kingdom | Tax | Employment status: Supreme Court dismisses Professional Game Match Officials Limited’s appeal in key tax case considering the employment status of part-time football referees",
        "date": "September 19, 2024",
        "content": "The appeal considered the employment status of part-time football referees in order to determine the way match fees paid to them should be treated for income tax and National Insurance purposes.\n\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Professional Game Match Officials Limited’s (“PGMOL”) appeal concerning the employment status of football referees, holding that the minimum requirements of mutuality of obligation (“MOO”) and control necessary for a contract of employment between the referees and PGMOL were satisfied in relation to the individual contracts.\n\nWhilst the Supreme Court considered the tests of control and MOO had been satisfied, in the light of all relevant circumstances and applying the guidance given by the Court of Appeal in HMRC v Atholl House Productions Limited [2022] EWCA Civ 501, it sent the case back to the First Tier Tribunal to decide whether all the tests were met to establish that the individual contracts were contracts of employment.\n\n\n\n[2018] UKFTT 528 (TC)\n\n\n\n[2020] UKUT 147 (TCC)\n\n\n\n[2021] EWCA Civ 1370\n\n\n\n[2024] UKSC 29\n\nVialto’s View\n\nWhilst it isn’t quite ‘game, set and match’ for HMRC given that the case has been remitted to the First Tier Tribunal, the principles established as regards MOO and control have important implications for businesses engaging contingent workers (whether directly or indirectly, e.g. via a personal service company (“PSC”)).\n\nThe Supreme Court’s confirmation that, for tax purposes, sufficient control can exist where there is a sufficient framework of control, even where the end user has no contractual right to intervene in every aspect of the performance of the worker’s duties, suggests that control, already a key test, will have even more importance going forward and may be subject to higher levels of HMRC scrutiny. Whilst HMRC’s approach remains to be seen, it may be that any element of control, such as the requirement to comply with certain policies and/or undertake training (perhaps even compliance training), or even suggestions on how a service could be improved, could be enough to establish sufficient control to support an employment relationship. It may be reasonable to expect further updates to HMRC’s Check Employment Status for Tax (“CEST”) tool to reflect the Supreme Court’s views.\n\nThe Supreme Court confirmed that, for tax purposes, a single engagement could have sufficient MOO to establish an employment relationship if work which has in fact been offered is in fact done for payment, even where there is no obligation under an overarching contract to offer or undertake work. This could have wide ramifications for a number of users of contingent workers, particularly businesses that rely on contractors to fill temporary / short-term highly skilled vacancies.\n\nHMRC will welcome the Supreme Court’s approach to MOO, which it will consider supports the approach it has consistently taken in relation to MOO, i.e. that it will effectively be present in all cases where work is provided and remuneration is paid. This presumption led to the omission of MOO from HMRC’s CEST tool and it is unlikely HMRC will change this approach in light of this decision. It will also be interesting to see whether this emboldens HMRC to appeal more employment status cases decided in the taxpayer’s favour given HMRC lost at both the First Tier and Upper Tribunals but succeeded at both the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decision sets an even higher bar to support an argument that there is either no MOO or control of the worker, such that it is likely more contractors will be deemed employees for tax purposes. Whilst all the facts and circumstances need to be considered, in our experience many businesses will find it difficult to convince HMRC that a relationship is genuinely one of self-employment where there is sufficient MOO and control to indicate an employment relationship.\n\nAs outlined above, PGMOL succeeded at both the First Tier and Upper Tribunals, but HMRC succeeded at both the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. Further, the Supreme Court heard arguments on 26 and 27 June 2023 but published its decision some 15 months later on 16 September 2024 and have ultimately remitted the case back to the First Tier Tribunal, elongating a process that has already taken over six years (which doesn’t include the period prior to PGMOL’s appeal being heard in the First Tier Tribunal) and will have incurred substantial costs for both PGMOL and HMRC (with further time and costs to be incurred for the First Tier Tribunal hearing).\n\nThis demonstrates the complexity of the current regime, which requires knowledge and understanding of complex legal tests and a wealth of case law. This complexity creates uncertainty and potentially additional costs for workers and employers alike, and many argue that it is stifling entrepreneurialism and economic growth in the UK. This complexity not only leads to disputes with HMRC, but also between workers and engagers. As the above demonstrates, resolving such disputes can take years to resolve, potentially at great expense to both taxpayers and HMRC.\n\nMany businesses, workers and advisers hope that the government may take the opportunity to consider how employment status for tax purposes is assessed, particularly given the commitment to review employment status for employment law purposes, with a view to implementing a simpler regime that creates more certainty for all relevant parties.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nSarah Hewson\nUK Employment Tax Technical Lead\n\nAsh Majithia\nGlobal Employment Tax Co-Lead\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here:www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nBrazil | The implementation of FGTS Digital is now effect in Brazil\n\nSummary\nAs of March 1, 2024, the FGTS Digital system has been implemented in Brazil. Notably, the payment deadline has now been extended from the 7th to the 20th day of the following month.\n\nThe detail\nImplemented since March 1, 2024, the digital FGTS system is designed to enhance accessibility and improve information management.\n\nAlso known as Severance Indemnity Fund, the FGTS consists in a mandatory monthly deposit made by the companies to the employee´s individual blocked account. The amount deposited is equivalent to 8% of the total remuneration paid, credited and/or delivered to each employee, with no set ceiling. In case of termination without just cause, the employer must also pay a penalty equivalent to 40% based on the total deposits made during the employment relationship.\n\nNot only does this update aim to simplify compliance with deadlines, but it also ensures precision in the amounts owed to employees. A notable feature is the introduction of FGTS payment via Pix with QR Code or copy-pasting the code. This change provides a significant advantage, as proof of payment will be available in real-time, optimizing efficiency.\n\nWith this payment method, employers won’t incur any costs, and there is no limit on the number of payment slip that can be paid. However, in cases of late payments, interest will be applied.\n\nThe new modality also offers flexibility in payment, enabling transactions on any day and time. Moreover, the payment deadline for monthly invoices has been extended from the 7th to the 20th, starting in April (for the values declared in March).\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFlavia Fernandes\nCountry Leader\n\nReinaldo Medina\nDirector\n\nJuliana Andres\nSenior Manager\n\nNatalia Pinto\nManager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "June 20, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nAustralia | Student visa measures to restrict ‘visa hopping’: Commencement of working holiday visa changes for UK citizens\n\nSummary\n\nFrom 1 July, visitor visa, Temporary Graduate and certain other temporary visa holders will be unable to apply for a Student visa whilst onshore in Australia.\n\nAlso, from 1 July UK citizens will be able to apply for a second or third Working Holiday visa without needing to do a period of specified (regional) work.\n\nThe detail\n\nAs part of the reform of the migration system, the Australian Government signaled changes to the student visa program to support the future integrity of the program.\n\nBuilding on other Student visa integrity measures introduced earlier this year, from 1 July 2024 holders of the following temporary visas will be prevented from applying for a subclass 500 Student visa whilst onshore in Australia:\n\n● Subclass 485 (Temporary Graduate)\n● Subclass 600 (Visitor)\n● Subclass 601 (Electronic Travel Authority)\n● Subclass 602 (Medical Treatment)\n● Subclass 651 (eVisitor)\n● Subclass 988 (Maritime Crew)\n\nThis restriction on onshore visa renewals is intended to combat ‘permanently temporary’ former international students living in Australia, in other words preventing certain temporary visa holders from going from one visa to another in order to extend their stay in Australia. The new measures mean that holders of the above visas will be required to depart Australia in order to apply for a Student visa and remain outside of Australia until their visa is decided.\n\nThis change is part of the Government’s Migration Strategy. A suite of reforms associated with the Strategy will be released throughout 2024.\n\nFinally, a reminder that from 1 July UK citizens will be able to apply for a second or third Working Holiday visa without needing to meet the specified work requirements. This is based on the entry into force of the UK- Australia Free Trade Agreement on 31 May 2023. This means that UK citizens are able to remain in Australia for up to three years on a Working Holiday visa (renewed annually) without needing to undertake a period of specified (regional) work.\n\nIf you would like to discuss any of these updates, please contact your Vialto representative or:\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nHong Kong | Application for mainland travel permits for Hong Kong and Macao residents (non-Chinese citizens) is now open\n\nSummary\n\nWith effect from 10 July 2024, non-Chinese Hong Kong permanent residents are eligible to apply for a card-type document, called Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao residents (non-Chinese citizens) (“the Permit”) allowing travel to Mainland China for short-term purposes, such as tourism and business, for multiple entries not exceeding 90 days per entry. With this Permit, the non-Chinese Hong Kong permanent resident will be able to enjoy self-service clearance at control points of the Mainland. The Permit will be allowed for multiple entry purpose with a maximum validity period of 5 years.\n\nThe detail\n\nDetails\n\n\n\nNon-Chinese Hong Kong permanent residents entering Mainland China with this Permit are prohibited from working nor studying in the Mainland unless they obtain the relevant work permit or study visa.\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, the application process involves 3 steps:\n\n1. Applying to the Hong Kong Immigration Department for access to information in relation to Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macau Residents (Non-Chinese Citizens) (“the Permit) to obtain a letter confirming:\n\na. Nationality declared to the Commissioner of Registration;\n\nb. The result of the applicant’s Verification of Eligibility for Permanent Identity Card; and\n\nc. Whether or not the applicant currently holds a Hong Kong SAR passport;\n\n2. Completing the online application form on the portal of the China Travel Service (Hong Kong) Limited website; and\n\n3. Attending the appointment with supporting documents and upon approval, collecting the Permit at the China Travel Service (Hong Kong) Limited.\n\nOur observation\n\nThe implementation of this new Permit will be welcome news to all non-Chinese individuals who are Hong Kong permanent residents as they in the past would have had to apply for China visas to visit the Mainland. This new arrangement complements the “northbound” multiple-entry visa initiative as announced by the Chief Executive in the 2023 Policy Address. Together with the immigration facilitation measures that have also been launched recently including launching and expanding the GBA “southbound” exit endorsement for talent to Beijing and Shanghai and extending the duration of stay in Hong Kong of the exit endorsement for business visit from seven days to 14 days, the “southbound and northbound” flow has been made more convenient, enhancing the two-way flow of talent. Employers with mobile employees crossing the borders may take these advantages of immigration facilitation to streamline business travel processed for their employees. However, employers are reminded to observe and comply with the tax and immigration obligations triggered by the business travels in both the Mainland and Hong Kong SAR.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Germany | Stricter rules and enforcement for unauthorized legal and immigration services",
        "date": "November 15, 2024",
        "content": "Effective January 1, 2025, any unauthorized legal services will be subject to fines of up to EUR 50,000. Immigration consulting and advice services are considered as legal advice. Companies should therefore ensure they rely on licensed and experienced legal professionals who are authorized to work in this regulated sector.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nThe German Legal Services Act (RDG) regulates who may offer legal services in Germany. As of 2025, stricter rules apply: any advisory services provided without the necessary legal authorization will be considered a violation of the RDG and will result in fines of up to EUR 50,000. This particularly includes advisory activities in immigration law – encompassing legal questions related to the entry, residence, and employment of foreign skilled workers in Germany.\n\nVialto Partners generally advises to ensure immigration-related legal advice should, as a matter of principle, be reserved for properly licensed attorneys as well as chambers of crafts, industry, and commerce (IHKs) in the course of their statutory responsibilities, along with municipal economic development agencies within their designated scope. This limitation ensures that immigration law advice is provided within a regulated framework, safeguarding both compliance and the interests of your business.\n\nRisks for employers and service providers\n\nInternational companies and their employees must be aware of the risks of engaging advisors without the proper legal authorization for immigration matters. Violations can lead to substantial fines, which may impact not only the service provider but also the company itself. This amendment is especially relevant as many companies rely on external advisors for skilled worker immigration.\n\nOur recommendation\n\nTo ensure compliance in all immigration and employment matters for foreign skilled workers in Germany, we recommend relying exclusively on licensed and experienced legal professionals who are authorized in this complex and increasingly regulated area. Our law firm and our professionals hold the relevant authorizations when required and can help ensure compliance with the RDG and immigration legislation.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMostafa Massoud\nPartner, Rechtsanwalt (Lawyer)\n\nInga Mayer\nSenior Manager, Rechtsanwältin (Lawyer)\n\nEva Witt\nManager, Rechtsanwältin (Lawyer)\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "United Kingdom | Spring Budget 2023",
        "date": "March 21, 2023",
        "content": "15 March 2023\n\nImpact: Medium\n\nKey tax announcements impacting employers and employees\n\nSummary\n\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer delivered the Spring Budget on 15 March 2023, setting out the UK government’s tax and spending plans for the financial year 2023/24. With a backdrop of over a million job vacancies in the UK, the theme of the budget was to encourage more in the UK to return to work with measures focused on parents, older workers, long term sick and disabled and welfare recipients.\n\nThe biggest announcements were in respect of pension changes and an expansion of childcare support. However, in the supporting documents, the government also announced its intentions to ensure employers have access to skills and talent from abroad and issued some interesting consultations\n\nOur UK Spring Budget summary for UK employers and employees, including global mobility considerations, is outlined below and includes:\n\nKey announcements\n\nPension changes\n\nA number of announcements were made in relation to pensions, including:\n\n\n\nVialto View\n\nThe increase to the AA and the removal of LTA charges before the LTA itself is abolished in 2024 will be welcomed by those otherwise caught by them. The two-stage process for the LTA, to remove the LTA charge in April 2023 but not abolish the LTA itself until April 2024, may reflect caution by HMRC to identify unintended consequences of removing the LTA. For example, the tax-free cash sum is capped by the LTA and in future will be subject to its own stand-alone cap, which will need to be put into legislation.\n\nHowever, the AA increase also highlights how far it has fallen behind inflation. Ten years ago, in 2013/14, the AA was £50,000. Had it simply been increased by inflation each year it would now be worth over £64,000 in 2023/24. Even after this Budget’s announcements, pension savers still have a lower AA in real terms than they had ten years ago.\n\nThe pensions industry has been campaigning for a rise in the MPAA – a blocker for many individuals after retirement age who would like to continue to work. The level of the MPAA may reflect a tension between encouraging older workers to stay in the workforce and continue to rebuild their pension savings, even if they had dipped into these during the COVID-19 pandemic, and HMRC’s concern of tax leakage if earnings for the over 55s are diverted through pension schemes and immediately paid out.\n\nWhat look on the face of it to be simple changes potentially have wider ranging implications than at first glance and we’ll be sharing more insights in this regard.\n\n\n\nChildcare\n\nA number of announcements were made in relation to childcare, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVialto View\n\nThe announcement to expand the current 30 hours of free childcare to those between the ages of 9 months and 3 years will be welcome news to many employees and employers. This, combined with other announcements (such as wraparound care availability), demonstrates that the government is committed to supporting parents to return to the workforce. However, as always the devil is in the details. The existing scheme has limitations (for example availability for expatriates is linked to immigration status) and there are income restrictions. If either partner (rather than considering joint incomes) earns over £100k, they are not eligible.\n\nFrom an employer perspective, many employers have shown an interest in supporting employees with childcare costs but there are limited ways this can be provided in a tax efficient manner following the barring of new entrants to childcare voucher schemes. Despite the announced changes to various childcare support, no announcements were made to enable employers to better support employees with childcare costs without further taxable earnings or a taxable benefit arising. Whilst the government is focused on lower paid earners, the prohibitive costs of childcare often inhibit both parents returning to work leading to a reduction in the UK’s overall productivity, a loss of experienced workers and acts to exacerbate various pay and pension gaps. Many employers may be disappointed that their options in this regard remain limited.\n\nMigration: UK immigration and business visitor rules\n\nThe government has announced an intention to simplify business visitor rules in the UK from autumn 2023; specifically, it is looking at expanding the range of short term business activities that can be carried out in the UK for up to 6 months and also reviewing permitted paid engagements. In addition, the government is looking at more enhanced provisions and a wider range of allowable activities as part of individual negotiations with various trade partners.\n\nThe Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) is undertaking a rapid Shortage Occupation List (SOL) assessment for the construction and hospitality sectors to address labour supply pressures – the full review concludes later this year. Before the summer, the government has confirmed they will add five construction occupations to the SOL which will come into effect before the summer parliament recess, although we have not been told which jobs. Finally, the government has indicated their commitment to review the SOL more regularly so that the legal migration system is quicker and more responsive.\n\nVialto View\n\nA very welcome announcement. We hope that the government will look broadly at the business visitor rules to align and simplify the business visitor rules across all compliance aspects (immigration, tax, payroll, social security).\n\nFocusing on UK immigration, a commitment to review the list of permissible activities for business visitors is also a positive move. The distinction between a visit and work is often grey or, worse, too tightly drawn. The government is considering how the list can be expanded and we understand it is a cross-government effort. We will continue to contribute actively to that review and clients should get in touch if they have their own ideas to put to the government.\n\nThe commitment to review the Home Office’s Shortage Occupation List is welcome. Minimum salaries are lower for jobs on the shortage list, fees are lower, supplemental work becomes easier and employers can employ some asylum seekers, while they wait for a decision. That review is not new, it was announced a few weeks ago, and Vialto can help clients to understand the process or submit responses where helpful.\n\nOther announcements\n\nQuick recap: key previous announcements relevant for 2023/24\n\nHere is a reminder of some of the measures that were announced in the Autumn Statement last November and which will be relevant from 6 April 2023.\n\nConsultations and calls for evidence\n\nWhat we did not see\n\nAs well as the announcements made in the Budget, there were other possible announcements that were noticeable by their absence. Some of the possible tax changes that had been discussed before the day, but which were not mentioned include the following:\n\n\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners’ point of contact, or alternatively one of our technical experts:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "November 15, 2024",
        "content": "If an employee is not employed for the entire calendar year, the threshold of non-detrimental days of non-return for the cross-border commuter status under double tax agreement Germany/Switzerland is to be determined pro rata temporis: five days are to be set for a full month of employment and one day for each additional full week of employment.\n\nWhen it comes to the taxation of cross-border commuters, the question often arises of how to calculate so-called non-return days. According to Article 15a, para. 2 of the Germany/Switzerland double tax agreement (DTA), the status of cross-border commuter is lost, in the case of employment during the entire calendar year, if the person does not return to their place of residence on more than 60 working days due to their work. The question is how to determine the number of non-return days in the case of employment that does not last the entire calendar year. This question was also at the center of a case decided by the Munich Tax Court (Munich Tax Court, judgment of 15.3.2024, 8 K 883/23).\n\nThe calculation of the threshold of non-detrimental days of non-return in cases where the employee is not employed in the other country for the entire calendar year should be calculated as follows: Five non-return days are set for each full month of employment, and one day for each additional full week.\n\nThis is also in line with the new protocol of amendment to the DTA Germany/Switzerland, signed on August 21, 2023, which is expected to come into force on January 1, 2025.\n\nSofern ein Arbeitnehmer nicht während des gesamten Kalenderjahres beschäftigt ist, ist die Grenze der nicht schädlichen Tage der Nichtrückkehr für die Grenzgängereigenschaft nach dem Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen Deutschland/Schweiz zeitanteilig zu ermitteln: für einen vollen Monat der Beschäftigung sind fünf Tage und für jede weitere volle Woche der Beschäftigung ein Tag anzusetzen.\n\nBei der Besteuerung von Grenzgängern nach dem Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen Deutschland/Schweiz (DBA) stellt sich oft die Frage, wie sogenannte Nichtrückkehrtage zu berechnen sind. Nach Artikel 15a Absatz 2 DBA Deutschland/Schweiz entfällt die Grenzgängereigenschaft dann, wenn die Person bei einer Beschäftigung während des gesamten Kalenderjahres an mehr als 60 Arbeitstagen auf Grund ihrer Arbeitsausübung nicht an ihren Wohnsitz zurückkehrt. Fraglich ist, wie die Nichtrückkehrtage bei einer Beschäftigung, die nicht das ganze Kalenderjahr über bestand, zu ermitteln ist. Diese Frage war auch im Mittelpunkt eines Falls, den das Finanzgericht München zu entscheiden hatte (FG München, Urteil vom 15.3.2024, 8 K 883/23).\n\nDie Berechnung der Grenze der nicht schädlichen Nichtrückkehrtage in Fällen, in denen der Arbeitnehmer nicht das gesamte Kalenderjahr im anderen Staat beschäftigt ist, erfolgt nach dem Finanzgericht München wie folgt: Für jeden vollen Monat der Beschäftigung werden fünf Nichtrückkehrtage angesetzt, und für jede weitere volle Woche ein Tag.\n\nDies steht auch im Einklang mit dem am 21.8.2023 unterzeichneten und voraussichtlich ab 01.01.2025 in Kraft tretenden neuen Änderungsprotokoll zum DBA Deutschland/Schweiz.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMathias Schmitt\nPartner\n\nDamaris Besenreuther\nSenior Manager\n\nSina Kunzweiler\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Germany | Immigration | Reform of the Skilled Workers Immigration Act passed",
        "date": "July 11, 2023",
        "content": "June 27th, 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nImpact High\n\nSummary\n\nThe Bundestag passed the reformed Skilled Workers Immigration Act on 23 June 2023. The intention is to facilitate the access for foreign skilled workers to the German labour market. Several simplifications are envisaged: To name a few, skilled workers with professional experience will in future be allowed to work without a qualification recognized in Germany. In addition, third-country nationals who meet certain criteria will be allowed to enter Germany with the so-called “opportunity card” (“Chancenkarte”) based on a points system to find a job.\n\nBackground\n\nThe shortage of skilled workers is omnipresent and cross-sectoral. According to surveys by the Federal Statistical Office, there are hardly any reserves left in Germany to replace missing or soon to leave skilled workers. According to the latest results, 87 percent of the population between the ages of 25 and 59 are already in gainful employment. Among men, the figure is as high as 92 percent, while 83 percent of women have a paid job. To tackle the shortage of skilled workers, the German immigration law has been opened up to a broader group of people.\n\nDetails\n\nThe skilled labour immigration law is based on a three-pillar: Skilled labour Pillar, Experience Pillar and Potential Pillar.\n\nSkilled labour\n\nThird country nationals with either a German qualification or a qualification recognized in Germany will be able to work in all qualified occupations. The EU Blue Card with its perks with regards to family reunification, permanent residency and change of employer/position is to be made available to even more skilled workers holding a university degree. Germany is thus implementing the regulations of the reformed EU Blue Card Directive for highly qualified immigrants.\n\nDetails:\n\n-The minimum salary threshold for the issuance of the EU Blue Card for academic professionals will be lowered to EUR 43,800 gross (currently: EUR 58,400 gross) p.a.\n\n– People without a university degree but with three years of vocational training will be able to obtain an EU Blue Card if they have a concrete job offer\n\n-(IT-) Specialists will be able to obtain an EU Blue Card if they do not have a university degree but can prove that they have certain non-formal qualifications\n\n-(IT-) Specialists are to be able to pursue any qualified occupation in future. Previously they had to prove a connection between educational background and job activities in Germany\n\nExperience\n\nEmployees not holding a university degree will be allowed to work in non-regulated occupations even without their vocational training  being formally recognized in Germany. Prerequisites are:\n\nThis means significant simplifications and thus shorter procedures. A minimum salary is set. Those who do not reach this salary threshold must have their vocational qualification recognized in Germany. What is new is that the person may already work in Germany while the recognition procedure is still ongoing. This exception applies if the employer allows the employee to conduct the qualification.\n\nPotential  – the opportunity card\n\nMore third country nationals seeking for an employment from within Germany will have the opportunity to find work locally in Germany. The minimum requirement is a vocational qualification of at least two years’ duration.\n\nWith a so-called “Chancenkarte” (opportunity card), they will receive a residence permit for an initial period of up to one year to look for work. During the job search, employment of up to twenty hours per week is permitted, including trial employment with a future employer for up to two weeks. The requirements for entry to seek training are also lowered.\n\nThe opportunity card will be issued based on a transparent and unbureaucratic points system. The selection criteria include:\n\nFurthermore, the potential of the accompanying spouse or partner is also considered. A qualification in a bottleneck occupation is a criterion to be scored for the opportunity card. The minimum requirement for German language skills is now only A 1; language skills from language level A 2 onwards are given extra points.\n\nThe law also provides for the possibility of extending the Chancenkarte for up to two years if the third country national has an employment contract or a binding job offer for qualified employment in Germany and the Federal Employment Agency agrees.\n\nFurther changes\n\nTemporary employment\n\nThe law also provides for the possibility of contingent short-term employment for sectors with particularly high demand. This makes it possible to work in Germany for eight months, regardless of the qualification. However, the employer must be bound by collective agreements and the employment will be subject to social security contributions from the first day of employment.\n\nChange from asylum seeker status to skilled worker\n\nPeople who are already in Germany and were in an asylum procedure until March 29th, 2023 can switch to regular employment if they have the appropriate qualifications. This gives people who have fled to Germany a perspective for more integration. However, this so-called track change from the asylum procedure to recognition as a skilled worker will only be possible retroactively. Asylum seekers who were not yet in the asylum procedure by March 29th, 2023 will not be eligible for this residence permit type.\n\nThe law still must be discussed and approved by the Bundesrat before they can enter into force.\n\nWhat this means\n\nFor employers, this mainly means that candidates will possibly already be in the country more often when they want to hire them and will not have to go through the visa process in their home country. Furthermore, the introduction of the law will give workers a great opportunity to apply for an EU Blue Card without having to explain in detail how their new job fits with the degree. The latter has led to challenges in many cases in the past.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe will monitor the situation closely and will reach out to our clients as soon as the changes are implemented. To guarantee clear and efficient processes, we keep our clients updated throughout the upcoming legislative procedure.\n\nWe can assist you, your employees and candidates as well as their family members with their relocation to Germany and how the upcoming changes can help you and them smoothly navigating through the German immigration system.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMostafa Massoud, Rechtsanwalt (Lawyer) | mostafa.massoud@vialto.com\n\nInga Mayer, Rechtsanwältin (Lawyer) | inga.m.mayer@vialto.com\n\nEva Witt, Rechtsanwältin (Lawyer) | eva.witt@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Belgium | Employment Tax | Important updates regarding the notifications of your project(s) and/or program(s) to BELSPO",
        "date": "June 4, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nBelgium | Important updates regarding the notifications of your project(s) and/or program(s) to BELSPO\n\nSummary\n\nThe R&D wage withholding tax partial exemption has undergone major changes since last year, but has also recently been indirectly impacted by a reorganization within BELSPO and the procedures specific to this entity.\n\nThrough this alert, we would like to briefly recall the actions that are incumbent on companies applying the R&D measure.\n\nIn detail\n\nReminder – New circular letter as from 1st August 2023\n\nAs from 1st August 2023 the Belspo notification must be submitted before the start of a project/program.\n\nThe consequences cannot be underestimated and vary depending on whether the project/program is already up and running or not. The new rules have been clarified by BELSPO through a public communication which can be found here: Belspo – R&D rules as of 01/08/2023 – FR version, Belspo – R&D rules as of 01/08/2023 – NL version.\n\nThe key aspects to be considered following this new circular may be summarized as follows:\n\n● The R&D exemption can only be applied when the R&D project or program has been notified to BELSPO before it begins. In the past and in situations where the project or program would have been notified after the start of the project or program, a prorata of the R&D exemption could be applied as from the moment of the notification. As from 1st August, such prorata is no longer possible thus implying that it becomes crucial to notify any project or program before their respective start.\n\n● In order to make sure that this requirement is fulfilled, our recommendation is to make sure to perform a notification of any new project or program which is expected to start in the coming weeks or months and for which the company expects to deploy employees on such a project or program. Given the fact there are no clear instructions about the notifications, we have noticed based on our experience due to recent audits that the authorities will most likely verify the potential timesheets, or any sort of time registration tool put in place by the company in order to check whether or not the company is compliant with the R&D rules. That being said, in order to avoid any debate on the question about the start of any project or program, it is recommended to notify any project or program before any employee starts to work on the project or program.\n\n● In the past, it was a common practice to perform an update in the course of January of the year and additional update notifications during the year when it was required through the BELSPO portal, following recommendations provided by BELSPO. As of 1st August 2023, this recommendation is no longer applicable. The emphasis is now given to the approach which consists of considering a realistic start and end date given the fact that the previous methodology may be deemed as not realistic. Therefore, the recommended approach is to indicate a realistic end date and no longer indicate an end date which was usually set on 31st December of any given year (i.e. annual update).\n\n● A separate copy of each notification should be kept (a print screen is recommended to be kept in case of a tax audit). Indeed, most likely tax authorities require proof of the exact notification date. Rather than simply adjusting existing notifications by overwriting existing data with new data, it is therefore recommended to keep a copy of each update at the time the updates occur (f.e. whenever a new project is added).\n\n● For projects and programs prior to 1st August 2023: projects and programs that are ongoing and for which the notification had been correctly made prior to 1st August 2023 will still qualify for the exemption going forward, even if the notification was made after the R&D project/programme had started (i.e., the previous administrative interpretation stays intact here). Until 31st July 2023, it is highly recommended to proceed with any notification of projects or programs which have not yet been notified but which may have already started.\n\nUpdates provided by BELSPO\n\nGeneral comment\n\nFollowing a general communication from BELSPO, it is expected that 1) an inventory of necessary adjustments to the software and 2) a start of the restructuring of BELSPO within the framework of the partial exemption from payment of the withholding tax for the R&D activities will happen in 2024.\n\nThe proposition is to set up two committees, i.e. an external and thematic expert committee in the third quarter of this year, and two A1-level officers, who will submit all the files to these committees. Please note that more information in this respect will follow later.\n\nAs this restructuring is currently in full process, it is not possible to schedule a meeting in the coming period with BELSPO until the new cell of BELSPO has officially been put in place, which of course could delay a number of requests which would have usually been raised to the attention of BELSPO.\n\nAdvisory application process for diplomas\n\nAmong the planned adjustments, one major adjustment concerns the advisory application regarding the application process for foreign degrees.\n\nAs a common practice, it is possible to ask BELSPO for advice regarding the validity of the project/program on the registration form. BELSPO then checks whether the diploma requirements have been met, and/or whether the registered research and/or development projects or programs aim at experimental development, fundamental or industrial research.\n\nHowever, as the requests for the advice regarding the (foreign) diplomas accumulated a gigantic backlog, BELSPO decided to implement a new procedure in order to fasten the process. Indeed, the diversity of foreign diplomas and the lack of a link between approved diplomas and BELSPO’s notification tool entails additional administrative processing. Therefore, the advisory application process for diplomas will be modified.\n\nFurthermore, they will strive to provide a clearer answer with a brief explanation of why the diploma was or was not approved.\n\nIndeed, as from now, a recommendation is requested by mailing a completed Excel file along with the necessary attachments to fiscal@belspo.be. The details linked to this new procedure can be found under the BELSPO platform.\n\nIt is crucial to note that this new way of working will take priority over all existing emails with advice requests for diplomas that have not yet been answered. Therefore, it is possible to renew old applications with the new form.\n\nList with qualifying degrees\n\nA number of degrees which were reflected on the platform of the BELSPO were not in line with the legislation.\n\nAs a result, the platform is now reflecting this change and provides only one link to the correct list of the qualifying degrees, which can be found here:\n\n● Adapted list – FR version\n● Adapted list – NL version\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnton Scornea\nSenior Associate\n\nMyriam Boudinar\nSenior Manager\n\nMaxime Deforche\nManager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "May 16, 2023",
        "content": "16 May 2023\n\nImpact High\n\nSummary\n\nPursuant to the client alert we published earlier in January 2023 on the Involuntary Loss of Employment (ILOE) Scheme, initially introduced on 12 October 2022 and mandatory for all employees working in the private and the federal sectors in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Mainland jurisdiction, the authorities have now extended the scope as of 3 May 2023, the ILOE scheme has been rolled out to all employees working in Free Zones and semi-government entities in the UAE. The scope of the scheme aims to provide security to UAE residents as well as Emirati and GCC nationals in case of redundancy or contract termination from the employer, with the exception of those employees who lose their jobs on disciplinary action and/or resignation.\n\nThe Detail\n\nAll Free Zone and semi-government based employees can now register for the Involuntary Loss of Employment (ILOE) or Unemployment Insurance Scheme, by visiting the designated ILOE website (iloe.ae). The steps that will need to be followed are slightly different in comparison to Mainland based employees; the ‘non-registered in MOHRE’ option will need to be selected. The premium can be paid monthly, quarterly or on a (semi) annual basis.\n\nThere are two categories for registering under the scheme, depending on the employee’s salary:\n\nCategory A: For all employees who earn a basic salary of AED 16,000 or less, their monthly compensation will be calculated at 60 percent of their basic salary and will be capped at AED 10,000 per month for a maximum period of three months from the date of termination.\n\nCategory B: With respect to employees who earn a basic salary of AED 16,000 or more, their monthly compensation will be calculated at 60 percent of their basic salary and will be capped at AED 20,000 per month for a maximum period of three months from the date of termination.\n\nUnder the ILOE scheme, the employee must fulfill the monthly insurance payments for at least twelve months in order to qualify for financial support for a period of no more than three months from the date of termination. The insurance scheme and its benefits will cease from the date the employee secures new employment in the UAE or three months from the date of redundancy/termination. Employees who resign from their employment or those terminated for disciplinary reasons will not be eligible to benefit from the scheme.\n\nWhat this means\n\nFree Zone employees must sign up for the Involuntary Loss of Employment scheme (ILOE) starting from 3 May 2023, and will have time to enroll until 30 June 2023. Failing to register will result in a fine of AED 400 per employee.\n\nThere are a number of selected insurance providers in the UAE to register under the scheme, however, it is recommended to use the official website iloe.ae. As Stated in our previous alert, employers are not obliged to enroll their employees in the insurance scheme or pay any contributions to the scheme but should make employees aware given the consequences of failing to enroll.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe will continue to closely monitor and provide timely guidance on any new updates by the UAE Immigration authorities and highlight the impact of any changes that may impact your expatriate workforce.\n\nContact us\n\nShould you have further questions on this update, please reach out to:\n\nRekha Simpson – Director, Middle East Immigration: rekha.simpson@vialto.com\n\nDounia Fathi-Benbrahim – Senior Manager, Middle East Immigration: dounia.fathi-benbrahim@vialto.com\n\nAnanth Prasad – Manager, Middle East Immigration: ananth.prasad@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Italy | Employment Tax | Inbound tax regime reform",
        "date": "December 25, 2023",
        "content": "December 21, 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nItaly | Inbound tax regime reform\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nOn December 19th, 2023 the Council of Ministers approved the final version of the Legislative Decree on International taxation providing some amendments to the Inbound tax regime, named “impatriati”. Companies and international employees should consider the below law updates which could impact the employment and global mobility strategies.\n\nThe Detail\n\nThe approved amendment affects the Italian special tax regime applicable on salaries of inbound employees. The changes impact the following areas:\n\n● The percentage of tax-exempt employment income is reduced from current 70% to 50% or to 60% where the major exemption applies only to employees with a child of age below 18 remaining resident in Italy with the parent employee.\n● An annual threshold of 600.000 € has been introduced. Employment income above this limit will be fully taxed.\n● The current qualifying conditions are amended as follows:\n\n❖ As a general condition, the individual must be non-tax resident in Italy in the 3 tax years preceding the transfer to Italy (the current tax law requires 2 years of non-tax residency). However, the condition of non-tax residency increases significantly if the employee, prior to transferring to Italy, held an employment relationship with the Italian employer or with an employer being part of the same group of the current employer. In this case, the non- residency requirement increases to:\n\n➢ 6 tax years, in case the foreign employment was not performed in favour of an Italian employer;\n➢ 7 tax years, in case the foreign employment was not performed in favour of an Italian employer.\n\n❖ The individual must become a tax resident in Italy and commit to maintain this condition for a period that should be of 4 years (the current tax law requires a minimum of 2 years of tax residence). The failure to respect this condition shall result in paying back the benefit obtained from the tax relief\nwith additional interests.\n\n❖ Carry out work activities mainly in Italy.\n\n● The following condition has been added:\n\n❖ The applicant should meet the requirement to be regarded as a highly qualified or specialised professional.\n\n● As for the current law provision, the tax benefit will apply for 5 years, starting from the tax year in which the taxpayer becomes an Italian tax resident. However, it will no longer be possible to extend the special tax regime for a further 5 years.\n\nTransitory provisions\n\nThe above-mentioned changes will not apply to the taxpayers who will register with the Italian record of resident population (i.e. anagrafe) by December 31st, 2023. These employees will be allowed to benefit from the current and more favourable inbound tax treatment.\n\nIn addition, those employees who will register with “anagrafe” in 2024 and become owners of an Italian residential property in the timeframe that goes from twelve months prior to their transfer in Italy and December 31st, 2023, will benefit from the possibility to extend the inbound tax regime for 3 additional tax years. The extension in these cases will allow for a tax exemption on 50% of employment income capped as above while the property will need to be used as their primary residence.\n\nHow we can help\n\nGiven the important impact that this tax reform will have on employment incomes, on the special inbound tax regime and on company global mobility and talent acquisition strategies, we would be more than glad to offer our assistance with specific case-by-case evaluations and guidance to secure the benefits offered by the current and the future laws.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nNicla Cimmino\nPartner\nnicla.cimmino@vialto.com\n\nSuzana Branilovic\nPartner\nsuzana.branilovic@vialto.com\n\nValentina Siciliani\nDirector\nvalentina.siciliani@vialto.com\n\nCiro Eligiato\nSenior Manager\nciro.eligiato@vialto.com\n\nEdoardo Plescia\nSenior Associate\nedoardo.plescia@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: http://www.vialtopartners.com",

        "title": "Malaysia | Key updates on e-PCB Plus",
        "date": "January 28, 2025",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nSummary\n\nFollowing the implementation of the transition plan towards the e-PCB Plus Phase 1 system in September 2024, the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia (MIRB) has recently announced that this new Monthly Tax Deduction (MTD) service system, will be officially introduced to replace the existing systems, i.e. e-PCB, e-Data PCB and e-CP39 for data submission and MTD payments by the end of January 2025, subject to the completion of the final testing. The new e-PCB PLUS system, is an integrated system operated under the MyTax portal, aiming to streamline the payroll tax deduction process for employers to ensure efficiency and accuracy of MTD reporting. The full implementation of e-PCB Plus will be announced before its official launch for use by all employers and users.\n\nThe detail\n\nEffective 16 January 2025, the current e-PCB system will be deactivated, and the employers and users will only have limited access to the existing system for viewing purposes, which will be available within a specified period to ensure that all MTD matters for the current and previous years are fully reconciled in the MIRB records. With this, the MIRB announced that all employers and users are required to register their role and update employer and employee information on the e-PCB Plus system through the MyTax portal immediately to ensure a smooth transition process.\n\nWe outline below the actions to be taken by all employers before the official launching of the new e-PCB Plus system to facilitate a smooth transition to the said system for January 2025 MTD submission and remittance: –\n\n\n\n*Note: If this has yet to be done\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria of employee information required:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: Please ensure that the employee information is correct and complete. Incorrect employee information entry will result in the failure of employee data processing.\n\nCurrently, the e-PCB Plus system does not provide any option for tax agents to access the platform through the Tax Agent e-Filing (TAeF) portal. As such, we can support employers in familiarising themselves with the appropriate procedures and safeguards in utilising the e-PCB Plus system to accomplish and submit the MTD data and payments.  Separately, it is anticipated that there are no changes as to how MTD is calculated subject to issuance of the annual specification for MTD calculations using computerised calculation. Nevertheless, from a global mobility perspective, employers will need to pay closer attention into how MTD for trailing income is reported in the year(s) subsequent to the departure of an assignee from Malaysia as income reporting and MTD payments occurring across different fiscal years may create undue discrepancies in the tax positions captured in the MIRB records under the e-PCB PLUS system.  This would necessitate reconciliation efforts to be made with the MIRB records in view of potential queries from them.  In this respect, employers may need to review and adopt a more consistent reporting approach on trailing income taking into account cost-benefit factors and other practical considerations.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nHilda Liow\nPartner\n\nLim Phing Phing \nPartner\n\nWee Lay Har \nDirector\n\nLoh Zi-Lynn \nSenior Manager\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "date": "May 24, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSouth Africa | Second Amendment of the Immigration Regulations of 2014\n\nSummary\n\nThe South African Immigration Department has published the Second Amendment to the Immigration Regulations of 2014.\n\nThe key revisions from the initial draft, and our alerts, include revised Application Forms, to give effect to the amendments, consolidation of forms and updates to the criteria for the newly-introduced Points-based system.\n\ni. Relaxation of Police Clearance Certificate Requirements\n\nApplicants, over the age of 18, are now only required to provide Police Clearance Certificates from all countries where they have resided for 12 months or longer in the five years immediately preceding the submission of the application for their visa or permanent residence applications (including their country of nationality) as opposed to the previous requirement to source a Police Clearance Certificate from every country resided in for a period of 12 months or longer since the age of 18.\n\nThis change was previously given effect in April 2023 through Immigration Directive No. 5 of 2023\n\nii. Removal of Radiological Report\n\nRadiological reports are no longer required for temporary residence visa and permanent residence applications previously given effect in April 2023 through Immigration Directive No. 5 of 2023.\n\niii. Change in visa status for the Spouse, Child or Parent of South African Citizens / Permanent Residents\n\nThe spouse or child of a South African citizen or permanent resident is now allowed to change status from a Visitor’s Visa to a Relatives Visa / Study Visa / Section 11(6) Visitor’s Visa from within South Africa previously given effect through Immigration Directive No. 7 of 2019.\n\nFurthermore the parent of a citizen or permanent resident child is allowed to change from a visa linked to their spousal relationship with a South African citizen or permanent resident, to a Relatives Visa or Section 11(6) Visitor’s Visa to fulfill their parental responsibilities towards the child, following the divorce / end of the spousal relationship.\n\nThis follows from Rayment and Others v Minister of Home Affairs and Others; Anderson and Others v Minister of Home Affairs and Others [2023] ZACC 40 whereby the Constitutional Court in South Africa deemed the previous Regulations unconstitutional and imposed the above-mentioned remedy.\n\niv. Relaxation of requirement for proof of Membership with Regulatory Body\n\nApplicants may now submit a proof of membership application in lieu of an approved Membership Certificate when applying for a Critical Skills work visa. However, in such circumstances, such Critical Skills Work Visa will only be issued for a period of up to 12 months (as opposed to the maximum of 5 years).\n\nv. Remote Work Visa Regime\n\nThe New Regulations provide for remote workers who wish to work from within the borders of South Africa for foreign companies and / or derive a foreign-sourced income.\n\nSuch applications must be submitted in terms of Section 11(2) of the Act which grants a work authorisation to a Visitor’s Visa (previously used for urgent short term work not exceeding 90 days).\n\nThe principal clarification is that foreigners must demonstrate gross earnings of minimum R1 million per annum. If the Remote Visa is issued for less than 6 months within a 36-month period, the foreign national is not required to register with the South African Revenue Service (SARS). If the visa duration exceeds 6 months within a 36-month period, they will need to register with SARS.\n\nFurther details on the prescribed requirements and processes will follow.\n\nvi. Points-based System\n\nThe New Regulations introduces the points-based system which will regulate the work visas issued in terms of Section 19 of the Immigration Act (the impact on the respective work visa categories contained therein is yet to be determined).\n\nThe criteria includes: age, qualifications, language skills, work experience, offer of employment, salary and any other relevant factor.\n\nFurther details on the prescribed requirements and processes will follow.\n\nPlease find attached a copy of the Gazetted New Regulations for your ease of reference.\n\nShould you have any queries, please contact your dedicated Vialto consultant, copying our Team Mailbox: za_immigration_south_africa@vialto.com\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nStephen Marlin\nPartner\n\nNatalie McLean\nSenior Manager\n\nSupriya Boodhena\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Social Security\n\nEU/EEA | Italy—Framework agreement for remote work\n\nIn brief\nIn the aftermath of Covid-19, it has become increasingly popular for employees to work from home. Italian employers that are employing foreign resident employees have been facing challenges from EU rules on social security. If the employee works 25% or more in the country of residence, the employer is obliged to pay social security contributions in this country.\n\nOn July 2023 the following countries have implemented a Framework Agreement: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Slovakia.\n\nSlovenia have opted in on the 01 September 2023 and Italy joined on the 01 January 2024.\n\nIn detail – Italy opts into the Framework Agreement\nItaly opts into the solution. This means that Italian employers who have an employee that resides in a country that has also opted into the Framework Agreement will – together with the employee – be able to choose that the employee can work up to 50% (that is 49.9%) in the country of residence.\n\nThe solution cannot be used for employees residing in Great Britain.\n\nOnly “teleworking” is included\nThe solution can only be used for employees who perform “telework”, i.e. distance work, in the country of residence. “Teleworking” is work, which can be carried out regardless of the place of work using IT.\n\nThe agreement therefore does not apply if:\n\nIt therefore important for Italian employers to inform the employees about the limits to the telework and to monitor the work pattern in a reasonable manner. Particular attention must be paid to whether the employee’s business trips, or customer meetings results in the solution not being applicable.\n\nIndividual agreement with the employee and A1 application\nThe employee and the employer must agree to opt into the solution. The Framework Agreement does not set formal requirements as to what such an agreement must contain.\n\nBased on the agreement, an A1 application must be submitted. The application for Italian social security, under Italian employment must be sent to the Italian authority. This procedure is different to the procedure governing ordinary A1 applications for employees working in two or more EU/EEA countries.\n\nEmployees who are not covered by the solution\nEven if Italy acceded to the solution, there will be part of the employee population that will not be covered by the solution.\n\nThis may in particularly be the case for employees who:\n\nFor these employees, it is important to be aware that the existing rules contain a number of mechanisms that can give the employee the flexibility to work from home more than 1 day a week.

        "title": "UAE | Immigration | New end-of-service saving scheme for selected employees",
        "date": "November 9, 2023",
        "content": "7 November 2023\n\nImpact Medium\n\nSummary\n\nFurther to the UAE Government’s introduction of a Voluntary Alternative End of Service Benefits Scheme, as of 1 November 2023, it is now possible for employees to participate in this newly created investment scheme. The new scheme aims to boost competitiveness in the private sector, and acts as an alternative for employees to be able to increase their end of service savings. This recent move follows the successful introduction of the DIFC Employee Workplace Savings scheme in 2020.\n\nThe Detail\n\nEmployers have the choice as to whether they subscribe under the new benefits scheme, or continue with the current gratuity scheme. Employees will only be able to invest in the scheme if their employer registers, via a subscription application with the MOHRE. Private sector mainland and freezone (outside of the DIFC) companies will now have the option to choose whether they want to register under the newly created scheme. Subscription is mandatory once employees are selected by their employers to participate in the alternative system. There is no minimum salary requirement to participate.\n\nWorkers who have been selected by their employers to participate in the new scheme will keep the gratuity they built up under the end of service gratuity system – employers will be required to ensure that entitlements from the previous period are preserved.\n\nEmployees who are participating in the new scheme will be able to make additional contributions (up to a maximum of 25% of their annual salary). Moreover, they are allowed to withdraw parts of the investments that have been acquired in their name. Furthermore, skilled employees will have the opportunity to choose their preferred investment option (from very safe to high risk) – unskilled workers can only participate in a ‘Guaranteed Capital Fund’, which is the least risky investment profile.\n\nCompanies interested in participating in the new scheme can register with the Committee that has been created by the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) and the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) or through the Ministry’s service channels. The employee can only earn return on investments if their employer pays their monthly salary as agreed in the employee’s employment agreement.\n\nEmployers have the right to withdraw from the scheme. However, the MOHRE should pre-approve withdrawal from the scheme. Further conditions to be allowed to withdraw are: a minimum participation time of one year, the absence of outstanding administrative fees and/or unresolved labour disputes, and having measures in place to ensure that the withdrawal does not affect the employees’ rights and/or gratuity schemes.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe creation of the new end-of-service scheme provides an alternative for employers and employees to be able to help boost savings at the end of employment and / or on retirement. Enabling employees to invest into an approved scheme and funds provides the opportunity of maximising their investment return, in a different way to the gratuity scheme which is calculated based on years of service and wage.\n\nEmployers in the private sector and free zones will need to make a choice whether they want to register their employees in the new scheme. Companies should evaluate their employee population, monthly contributions that would need to be made, as well as weighing up the benefits associated with the new scheme.\n\nHow we can help\n\nShould you have any questions in relation to the new voluntary savings scheme, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nContact us\n\nShould you have further questions on this update, please reach out to:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com",

        "content": "6th April 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nImpact High\n\nSummary\n\nUpcoming changes for offshore workers include a decisive end to the offshore wind workers concession on 30th April 2023. Furthermore, new reporting duties for offshore workers will be introduced on 12th April 2023, requiring notifications to be made to the Home Office confirming when an offshore worker arrives and leaves the UK territorial waters.\n\nThe Detail\n\nEnd to Offshore wind workers concession\n\nOn the 30th of April 2023, the concession which allows non-UK/Irish nationals coming to the UK for the purpose of joining a vessel engaged in the construction and maintenance of a wind farm within UK waters, will come to an end. Individuals now coming to work on UK territorial waters will need permission to work in the UK before starting work.\n\nEmployers who have workers on wind farms within territorial waters, should therefore look to regularise the position of their workers to ensure full compliance with UK immigration legislation.\n\nNew reporting requirements for offshore workers\n\nFrom 12th April 2023, new reporting requirements will be introduced where notifications must be made to the Home Office confirming the dates in which an offshore worker arrives in the UK territorial waters (for the purpose of undertaking work in those waters,) and leaves without passing through immigration control.\n\nWhere an offshore worker holds sponsored immigration permission, the sponsor must make the notification:\n\n• no earlier than the date the worker arrives in or leaves UK waters (whichever is relevant), and\n\n• no later than 10 working days after the date the worker arrives in or leaves (whichever is relevant) UK waters.\n\nThere is currently no provision to make these notifications on the Sponsor Management System (SMS), but this is noted to form part of the sponsor duties and failure to notify could lead to the revocation/downgrading of a sponsor licence.\n\nNotifications must be made by emailing the Offshore worker notification inbox (offshoreworkernotificationsinbox@homeoffice.gov.uk) with the following information:\n\nThere is no need to report where the worker temporarily leaves the UK territorial waters, e.g. for a holiday or rest, during a period of valid permission, but where new entry clearance is obtained for a new job a separate notification will be required.\n\nThere will be a separate notification process for offshore workers who do not require sponsorship which is yet to be announced.\n\nNotifications will not be required where the individual passes through immigration control on the UK landmass before arriving in UK waters.\n\nHow we can help\n\nYour Vialto Partners contact can assist you with navigating these changes and ensuring reporting conditions are met.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "17 March 2023\n\nHighlight\n\nOn March 14, 2023, the National Immigration Administration made further adjustments to the visa and entry policies for foreigners coming to China.\n\nThe Details\n\nStarting from March 15, 2023, the following changes apply to the visa and entry policy for foreigners coming to China.\n Chinese visas issued before March 28, 2020, and still valid, have been reactivated, allowing travellers to use their visas for visiting China;\n Visa-free entry to Hainan Province, visa-free entry to Shanghai for cruise ships, visa-free entry to Guangdong Province for foreign tour groups from Hong Kong and Macau, and visa-free entry to Guilin city for ASEAN tour groups have been resumed.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese Embassies and Consulates overseas also followed and announced the same updates with more adjustments including,\n\n Resuming the issuance of visas to foreigners (including tourist, medical etc.);\n Resuming the review and issuance of all types of port visas by the China’s port visa authorities.\n\nWhat this means\n\nAll the China’s visa restrictions have been lifted, except for visa-free policy for citizens of Singapore, Japan and Brunei which remain in suspension.\n\nIt is important to note that any visas issued before March 28, 2020 can only be used if the traveler’s purpose for visiting to China remains the same as shown on the visa. Also, if the traveler holds two valid Chinese visas (one issued before March 28, 2020 and one issued after), they must inform the Chinese Customs which visa they intend to use for entering into China. For example, if Mr. A has a 10-year China business (M) visa on his old US passport, and also a work (Z) visa on his new US passport, and he intends to enter China for a business meeting. In that case, he must bring both passports and show to the Chinese Customs that he is travelling for business purposes and would therefore like to use his business (M) visa for entering into China.\n\nThere is an upward trend in international travel, and visa appointment waiting periods in several countries have grown longer. It is recommended to consider seeking expert assistance if required. We must remain alert to the most current updates in border control measures and immigration regulations.\n\nAlso, it is advisable to examine the mobility policy, STBT policy, deployment model, compensation strategy, tax arrangement and remote work policies etc. and make appropriate revisions and enhancements.\n\nContact us\n\nPlease reach out to your usual Vialto Partners contact should you have any questions on the above.

Additionally, passengers from the PRC to the United States should be aware of the following considerations:\n\n\n\nThe negative COVID-19 test requirement applies to air passengers from the PRC regardless of nationality and vaccination status.\n\nThe test requirement will also apply to persons traveling from the PRC via third country transit and to passengers connecting through the United States onward to further destinations.  The test requirement does not apply if passengers have spent less than 24 hours in China, Hong Kong or Macau\n\nAlong with applying this requirement to direct flights from the PRC, passengers transiting through Incheon International Airport, Toronto Pearson International Airport, and Vancouver International Airport on their way to the United States will be required to provide a negative COVID-19 test no more than 2 days before their departure to the United States, if they have been in the PRC in the last 10 days.\n\nThe Biden Administration chose these transit hubs because they cover a significant majority of travelers originating in the PRC, Hong Kong, and Macau. The announcement indicates that it will continue to monitor travel patterns and update this policy accordingly.\n\nPassengers who tested positive more than 10 days before the flight can provide documentation of recovery from COVID-19 in lieu of a negative test result if they had COVID-19 within 90 days prior to travel to the US.\n\n\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) Proposed Rule to Adjust Certain Application Fees for Employment-Based Petitions\n\n\n\nOn January 3, 2023, DHS proposed a new rule to adjust certain application fees. Under the new fee proposal, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) would:\n\n\n\nIncrease H-1B application fee from $460 to $780, which is a 70% increase.\n\nIncrease L-1 application fee from $460 to $1385, which is a 201% increase.\n\nIncrease the fee for H-1B cap registration from $10 to $215 per registration.\n\nIncrease O-1 application fee from $460 to $1055, which is a 129% increase.\n\nIncrease Forms I-485 (adjustment of status), I-131 (advance parole), and I-765 (employment authorization document) on paper with biometric services from $1225 to $2820, which is a 130% increase. If the filing includes dependents, the application fee will be significantly higher.\n\nIncrease various percentages of other types of employment-based petitions application fees.\n\nIncorporate biometrics costs into the main benefit fee and remove the separate biometric services fee.\n\nChange the premium processing timeframe from 15 calendar days to 15 business days.\n\nImplement lower fees for certain forms filed online.\n\n\n\nPursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, DHS published the new fee proposal on the Federal Register for 60 days starting on January 4, 2023. During the 60-day public comment period, the public will have the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes and DHS will finalize the fee schedule in response to such comments.  Once the comment period ends, DHS will review, make modifications to the proposed fee rule, if any and then publish the final rule.\n\n\n\nVialto Partners will continue to provide additional information on the implementation of the proposed new fee rule as it becomes available.\n\nContact us\n\nPlease reach out to Manish Daftari (manish.daftari@vialto.com) to discuss further.\n\n\n\nwww.vialtopartners.com",

        "title": "United States | DHS partially vacates Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haiti",
        "date": "February 24, 2025",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nThe US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has partially vacated the July 1, 2024 decision by former Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas regarding Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haiti. The February 2025 DHS decision changes the previously scheduled expiration date for Haiti TPS from 18 months to 12 months. Absent DHS action, the TPS designation for Haitian nationals and associated EADs will now end on August 3, 2025.\n\nThe detail\n\nBackground\n\nOn January 21, 2010, former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano designated Haiti for TPS based on country conditions. DHS extended the TPS designation for Haiti in 2011, which was then extended several times before termination was announced on January 18, 2018. The 2018 announced termination was challenged in several lawsuits, which required DHS to continue Haiti TPS temporarily pending case outcomes.\n\nOn August 3, 2021, former Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas announced a new TPS designation for Haiti for 18 months. In February 2023, DHS extended TPS status for another 18-month extension and issued a new designation (distinct from the 2021 designation). On July 1, 2024, Secretary Mayorkas decided to extend and newly designate Haiti for TPS for an additional 18 months, set to expire on February 3, 2026.\n\nImplications for Haitian individuals\n\nOn February 20, 2025, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that it would “rescind” the July 1, 2024 decision by former Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas regarding TPS for Haiti. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s decision moved the scheduled expiration date for Haiti TPS to August 3,\n\n2025. The February 2025 decision impacts both the 2021 and 2023 redesignations, and the new registration period that began in 2024. Thus, Secretary Noem’s decision impacts both TPS initial and extension applications by Haitian nationals. Any pending TPS applications will be given an expiration date of August 3, 2025.\n\nThe February 2025 decision also impacts TPS documents issued with the February 3, 2026 expiration date. These documents—including USCIS I-824 approval notices, associated Employment Authorization Documents (EADs), and I-94s—will now be considered to expire on August 3, 2025. USCIS will not issue new TPS-related documents with the August 3, 2025 expiration date to individuals who have a document with the February 3, 2026 expiration date.\n\nThe February 2025 decision also states that employers that previously accepted or are presented an EAD with the TPS category of A-12 or C-19 that expires on February 3, 2026 must update their records to note that the validity date of the document is now August 3, 2025.\n\nDHS has until June 4, 2025 to determine whether they will extend any TPS designation for Haiti. If DHS does not, it means that Haitian nationals who registered under a TPS designation will expire after August 3, 2025.\n\nWhat this means\n\nHaitian nationals who are in the United States on TPS status and are authorized to work through the benefit of an EAD will lose their status and work authorization as of August 3, 2025, unless DHS grants an extension or applicants are able to change to an alternate status that would allow them to remain and/or work in the US. Haitian nationals who currently fall under TPS status and employers who currently employ Haitian nationals with a TPS-based EAD should monitor official DHS communications for updates on the status of TPS designations and re-registration procedure.\n\nWe will continue to monitor any changes to the TPS program and are available to provide further guidance.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nManish Daftari\nPartner\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nLuxembourg | The “rental premium”: an opportunity to optimize employee remuneration?\n\nSummary\n\nThe law dated 22 May 2024 introduces a series of measures which aims to stimulate the Luxembourg housing market. Among the package of tax measures, there is one which impacts employment tax. The new law introduces a new paragraph 13c in article 115 of the Luxembourg income tax law, which allows, under certain conditions, the tax exemption of a “rental premium”. This new measure is applicable as from 1 June 2024.\n\nThe detail\n\nDescription of the law\n\nHow does the exemption work?\nThe new paragraph 13c of article 115 of the LITL (Luxembourg income tax law) provides for the exemption of 25% of a “rental premium” paid monthly by an employer to an employee in connection with the rental of their main residence.\n\nConditions\nThe conditions provided for in 13c of the article 115 of the LITL are the following:\n\nA Grand-Ducal decree also dated 22 May 2024 provides additional practical details on how employer can implement the “rental premium”.\n\nThere is no limitation regarding the country where the rented property is located. This provision therefore also applies to frontier workers meeting the above conditions. The exemption must be requested and claimed via the Luxembourg payroll.\n\nPractical example\n\nAssumptions\nCompany X hires a new employee aged 28 and paying a rent of EUR 1,500 per month excluding utilities. He is single and benefits from tax class 1. His monthly gross base salary amounts to EUR 4,200 (scenario A). The company may decide to structure the remuneration package differently, offering him a monthly gross base salary of EUR 3,200 plus a monthly gross “rental premium” of EUR 1,000 (scenario B).\n\nComparative calculations\n\n* including employee and CO2 tax credits\n\nConclusion\n\nThis regulation provides some limited relief to employees facing high rental costs. However, the implementation requires employers to manage a substantial administrative burden in order to ensure compliance.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nEric Paques\nPartner\n\nDenise Chambers\nDirector\n\nQuentin Cosco\nManager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nQatar | Update to the Residence Permit procedures\n\nSummary \nThe Ministry of Interior has announced that employers and employees in Qatar are required to complete the Residence Permit procedure within 30 days of arrival to the country.\n\nThe detail \nEarlier in February the Ministry of Interior announced the importance of the employer and employee to complete the Residence Permit procedures within 30 days of entering the country, in accordance with the law. Failure to do so may lead to a fine of QAR 10,000 (approx. USD 2,740). This new directive applies to both mainland Qatar as well as freezones.Previously, the legal period to complete a Residence Permit was 90 days from the employee date of arrival to the country.\n\nThe Residence Permit procedures include medical and biometrics tests scheduling and clearance, as well as the local employment contract legalisation for mainland entities. Applicants will be reminded that once they enter Qatar on Work Visa travel outside Qatar is not permitted until the issuance of their Residence Permit.\n\nWhat this means \nIt is important for employers and employees to ensure that the necessary documentation including legalisations, are acquired prior to the employee entering the country, to ensure completion of the Residence Permit issuance to avoid fines.

        "title": "European Union | Immigration | Temporary Protection Directive to be extended",
        "date": "June 19, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nEuropean Union | Temporary Protection Directive to be extended\n\nSummary\n\nOn 13 June 2024, the EU Council welcomed the Commission’s proposal to extend the Temporary Protection Directive for another year. This means that the residence and work rights of Ukrainian nationals in the EU are likely to be secured until at least 4 March 2026. The EU Council is yet to formally adopt the relevant proposal and member states will need to implement the extension into national law.\n\nThe detail\n\nThe Temporary Protection Directive (TPD) was activated on 4 March 2022, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, to provide immediate and temporary protection to those fleeing the conflict. The  Directive grants beneficiaries residence rights, access to the labour market of the country where they reside, accommodation, social welfare assistance, medical care, and other forms of support.\n\nIn an explanatory memorandum, the Commission concludes that reasons for temporary protection persist and that the TPD should be extended as an appropriate and necessary response to the current situation. With the TPD extension, the Commission aims to provide beneficiaries with access to a set of harmonised rights across the EU while mitigating a possible burden on member states’ asylum systems.\n\nBeneficiaries of the TPD include Ukrainian nationals and, in some member states, specific groups of non-Ukrainian nationals who were residing in Ukraine at the time of the Russian invasion. However it is possible that member states that have granted TPD status to those groups of non-Ukrainian nationals will only extend TPD status for Ukrainian nationals beyond 4 March 2025. This is a result of some member states signalling that they expect that non-Ukrainian nationals should be able to return to their home country.\n\nAs a next step, member state representatives of the EU Council are expected to formally adopt the Commission’s proposal. Once the proposal has been formally adopted, member states will be required to implement the extension.\n\nIt is advisable for employers to ensure they are aware of the above changes and whether their workforce will be impacted, for example due to the withdrawal of TPD status for certain groups from 4 March 2022.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nSharan Kundi\nPartner, Global Immigration Leader\n\nHugo Vijge\nDirector, Europe Immigration Advisory Lead\n\nMarijan Vrhovac\nSenior Associate\n\nFabian Gielis\nAssociate\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "July 1, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nFrance | Parliamentary elections and what it could mean for immigration\n\nSummary\n\nThe first round of the French parliamentary elections will take place on Sunday 30 June. Immigration is a key policy area for voters, which could lead to a shift in policy if a new party obtains a majority in the Assemblée nationale. However, it is not clear whether highly skilled migration would be impacted in such a scenario.\n\nThe detail\n\nOn 30 June and 7 July, French voters will elect legislative representatives in the Assemblée nationale. This is following French President Emmanuel Macron’s decision to call a snap election after the EU Parliamentary elections, in which his party suffered a heavy defeat to the right-wing National Rally.\n\nImmigration was a key issue in the debate before the EU elections, with an Ipsos exit poll showing that for 43% of voters, immigration was a decisive policy area in determining their vote. In the run-up to the upcoming national elections, immigration remains at the top of the political agenda.\n\nThe current debate focuses on irregular and asylum migration.\n\nWhile Macron’s migration policies have been moving towards more protectionist measures in recent months, Le Pen’s national rally has for many years promoted significantly stricter immigration policies. According to political analysts, this is one of the reasons why the National Rally now leads the polls at 34%, ahead of Macron who trails at 20% according to Ipsos.\n\nThe leftist coalition of Nouveau Front Populaire, who stand for a more open immigration policy, has been critical of Macron’s recent legislative initiatives and have been polling at 29.5%.\n\nDespite immigration being a key topic for all parties in the political debates, there have been no specific policy announcements on talent mobility or highly skilled migration. This is likely due to the fact that the main parties aim to balance stricter immigration policies in some areas, such as asylum, against measures that promote national interests such as international business and skills and talent shortages.\n\nIn any case, regardless of the outcome of the election, immigration will continue to be a key policy area in the run up to the vote on 30 June and the run-off on 7 July. How this will impact the immigration landscape more broadly remains to be seen.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nSharan Kundi\nPartner, Global Immigration Leader\n\nArzhvaël Le Fur\nPartner\n\nViolaine Jaussaud\nSenior Manager\n\nHugo Vijge\nDirector\n\nFrédérique Montalti\nDirector\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Germany | Employment Tax | Planned amendment to Section 19a income tax act—special provision for income from employment in the case of equity participations—Annual Tax Act 2024 (JStG)",
        "date": "July 31, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nGermany | Planned amendment to Section 19a income tax act—special provision for income from employment in the case of equity participations—Annual Tax Act 2024 (JStG)\n\nSummary\n\nOn 5 June 2024, the Federal Cabinet adopted the draft of the Annual Tax Act 2024, which extends the scope of application of the special provision for equity participations to group companies within the meaning of Section 18 stock corporation act (AktG). The advantage of deferred taxation of non-cash benefits in the case of participations will therefore not only apply to the granting of a participation in the company itself, but also to participations in a group company, i.e. shares issued by the parent company. In order to apply the tax concession, the thresholds of Section 19a (3) income tax act (EStG), i.e. micro, small or medium-sized company requirement, are valid in relation to the total of all group companies. In addition, no group company may have been founded more than 20 years ago.\n\nDetails\n\nSection 19a income tax act (EStG) is a special provision to avoid the taxation of so-called &quot;dry income&quot; in the case of a free or discounted transfer of equity and equity-like participations in the employer’s company to the employee. In principle, the pecuniary benefit from the free or reduced-price transfer of shareholdings qualifies as wages and is subject to wage tax deduction. Section 19a of the German income tax act (EStG) allows for a deferred taxation of the monetary benefit from the transfer of such shareholdings.\n\nSection 19a (4) EStG specifies the circumstances in which subsequent taxation must take place at the latest. This occurs if a participation in assets is transferred further, the employment relationship with the previous employer is terminated or 15 years have passed since the transfer of the assets.\n\nSection 19a EStG only applies if the employer’s company does not exceed the following thresholds at the time of the transfer of the shareholding or has not exceeded them in one of the six preceding calendar years:\n\nIn addition, the company must not have been founded more than 20 years ago.\n\nThe draft of the Annual Tax Act 2024 now plans to extend the scope of application of the special provision to group companies within the meaning of Section 18 AktG. The above-mentioned thresholds in accordance with Section 19a (3) EStG will continue to apply in relation to all group companies as a whole, and in addition, no group company may have been founded more than 20 years ago.\n\nThe regulation is to come into force retroactively from 1 January 2024 with the amendment to the Income Tax Act.\n\n\n\nGermany | Geplante Änderung des § 19a EStG (Konzernklausel) – Sondervorschrift für Einkünfte aus nichtselbstständiger Arbeit bei Vermögensbeteiligungen – Jahressteuergesetz 2024 (JStG)\n\nZusammenfassung\n\nAm 05.06.2024 beschloss das Bundeskabinett den Entwurf zum Jahressteuergesetz 2024. Entsprechend wird der Anwendungsbereich der Sondervorschrift für Vermögensbeteiligungen auf Konzernunternehmen i.S.d. § 18 AktG erweitert. Der Vorteil der nachgelagerten Besteuerung der geldwerten Vorteile bei Vermögensbeteiligungen am Unternehmen des Arbeitgebers soll folglich nicht nur Anwendung bei der Gewährung einer Beteiligung am eigenen Unternehmen finden, sondern auch bei Beteiligungen an einem Konzernunternehmen, d.h. z.B. im Bezug auf von der Muttergesellschaft ausgegebene Anteile. Zur Anwendung der Steuerbegünstigung dürfen die Schwellenwerte des § 19a Abs. 3 EStG, d.h. es muss ein Kleinstunternehmen oder ein kleines oder mittleres Unternehmen vorliegen, in Bezug auf die Gesamtheit aller Konzernunternehmen nicht überschritten werden. Zusätzlich darf die Gründung keines Konzernunternehmens länger 20 Jahre zurückliegen.\n\nDetails\n\n§ 19a EStG ist eine Sondervorschrift zur Vermeidung der Besteuerung von sog. „Dry-Income“ bei einer unentgeltlichen oder verbilligten Überlassung von Vermögensbeteiligungen am Unternehmen des Arbeitgebers an den Arbeitnehmer. Grundsätzlich ist der geldwerte Vorteil aus der unentgeltlichen oder verbilligten Überlassung von Vermögensbeteiligungen als Arbeitslohn zu qualifizieren und unterliegt dem Lohnsteuerabzug. § 19a EStG ermöglicht die nachgelagerte Besteuerung des geldwerten Vorteils aus der Übertragung solcher Vermögensbeteiligungen..\n\n§ 19a Abs. 4 EStG nennt die Tatbestände, wann spätestens eine Nachversteuerung zu erfolgen hat. Dies tritt ein, sofern die Vermögensbeteiligung weiter übertragen wird, das Dienstverhältnis zu dem bisherigen Arbeitgeber beendet wird oder seit Übertragung der Vermögensbeteiligung 15 Jahre vergangen sind.\n\nDabei findet § 19a EStG nur Anwendung, insofern das Unternehmen des Arbeitgebers im Zeitpunkt der Übertragung der Vermögensbeteiligung folgende Schwellenwerte nicht überschreitet:\n\nZusätzlich darf die Gründung des Unternehmens nicht mehr als 20 Jahre zurückliegen. Der Entwurf des Jahressteuergesetzes 2024 plant nun den Anwendungsbereich der Sondervorschrift auf Konzernunternehmen i.S.d. §18 AktG zu erweitern. Dabei finden die oben genannten Schwellenwerte gemäß §19 a Abs. 3 EStG weiterhin in Bezug auf die Gesamtheit aller Konzernunternehmen Anwendung und zusätzlich darf nun die Gründung keines Konzernunternehmens länger als 20 Jahre zurückliegen.\n\nDie Regelung soll mit der Änderung des Einkommensteuergesetzes rückwirkend zum 1. Januar 2024 in Kraft treten.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMathias Schmitt \nPartner\n\nSabrina Sandmann\nDirector\n\nDamaris Besenreuther\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "October 4, 2023",
        "content": "October 2023\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nOn 28 September 2023, EU member states agreed to extend the validity of the current EU Temporary Protection Directive (TPD) until 4 March 2025. The Dutch government has implemented this extension automatically. This means that Ukrainians in the Netherlands will be able to continue to enjoy the current protection such as shelter, medical care, work rights and education based on the TPD until at least 4 March 2025.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe extension of the TPD means that the rights of Ukrainians and other beneficiaries of the Directive would also be extended, including work rights. This is relevant for employers who employ Ukrainian nationals or other individuals whose work rights are linked to the TPD.\nIn this respect it is relevant to note that beneficiaries of the TPD will have received a residence card or passport sticker as proof of their rights in the Netherlands. In addition, employers are required to notify the Netherlands Employees Insurance Agency (UWV) when hiring a beneficiary of the TPD.\n\nFinally, the Dutch government has been reviewing its policy for non-Ukrainian nationals who are covered by the TPD, for example because they resided in Ukraine on the basis of a residence permit before the TPD took effect. Currently, these individuals are permitted to remain in the Netherlands, however the Dutch Council of State is due to issue a final ruling on an pending appeal to determine the rights of this group of individuals. This group can expect to receive a letter from the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) about this temporary extension. As long as the Dutch Council of State has not yet issued a final ruling, they retain the same rights as Ukrainian nationals in the Netherlands under the TPD.\n\nHow we can help\n\nFeel free to reach out to your Vialto Partners contact for more information on this extension of the TPD.\n\nVialto Partners will closely monitor this development and we will ensure businesses and individuals can prepare for any upcoming changes.\n\nContact us\n\nFor further details on the above, please do reach out to your usual Vialto Partners contact or alternatively contact\n\n● Nini Braken-Zheng, Senior Immigration Advisory Associate, nini.braken-zheng@vialto.com\n● Hugo Vijge, Director, Europe Immigration Advisory Lead, hugo.vijge@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "25 August 2023\n\n[Global Mobility Tax]\n\nIndia | Tax | Recent updates\n\nImpact High\n\nSummary\n\nExemption for proceeds received under a life insurance policy.\n\nThe Indian taxation laws provide exemption in respect of proceeds received under a life insurance policy, including the sum allocated by way of bonus on such policy, subject to certain exclusions. In the Finance Act 2023 further restrictions were introduced in respect of life insurance policy [other than unit linked insurance policy (‘ULIP’) or term life insurance policy] issued on or after 1 April 2023 as below:\n\nHowever, no restriction shall apply in case of any sum received under one or more life insurance policies on the death of the taxpayer.\n\nIn order to provide clarity on this new amendment and guidance on implementing the same, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (“CBDT”) has now issued a Circular1 providing different scenarios and examples for computing the exemption.\n\nThe CBDT also introduces a new rule outlining the method for calculating the amount of taxable income for cases where the above exemption is not claimed or allowed to the taxpayer.\n\nAmendment in perquisite valuation rule of Rent-Free Accommodation (RFA)\n\nThe CBDT has notified lower rates of valuation i.e., 10%, 7.5% or 5% of salary as against the earlier rates of 15%, 10% or 7.5% of salary, respectively for RFA provided by private sector employers to its employees. These percentages are linked to revised population threshold of cities in which the accommodation has been provided. It has also introduced capping of the RFA valuation based on the cost inflation index (‘CII’) in cases where the employee stays in employer owned RFA for more than a year. This is effective from 1 September 2023 onwards.\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrection in the Tax payment challan\n\nPresently, the rectification of any error made while filling the challan for depositing of taxes is cumbersome and can only be addressed in coordination with the bank or the jurisdictional assessing officer. A new feature has been enabled to conduct such corrections directly by the taxpayer using one’s online account at tax filing poral with ease within the prescribed timeline.\n\nThe Detail\n\nExemption for proceeds received under a life insurance policy\n\nUnder the Indian taxation law, exemption in respect of proceeds received, including the sum allocated by way of bonus on such policy, is not allowed in respect of the life insurance policy where the premium payable for any of the years during the term of such policy exceeds –\n\nThe Finance Act, 2023 has introduced further restrictions in respect of claiming exemption of life insurance policy (other than ULIP or term life insurance policy), issued on or after 1 April 2023 as below:\n\nIn case the exemption is not claimed, the consequent taxable income shall be taxable under the head “income from other sources”. However, deduction shall be allowed for premium paid if such premium has not been claimed as deduction earlier.\n\nExamples of Circular no. 15 of 2023 are explained below:\n(For ease of reference we have indicated the example serial number same as in the Circular)\n\nExample 6\n\nExample 7\n\nExample 9\n\nExample 10\n\nOption 1 (taxpayer opts to claim exemption of Policy X)\n\nOption 2* (taxpayer does not opt to claim exemption of Policy X)\n\n*This option is tabulated basis the clarification provided by CBDT against Example 10 in the Circular.\n\nNew Rule introduced\n\nA newly notified rule outlines the method for computing taxable income under the head ‘income from other sources. If an individual receives a sum from a life insurance policy, the taxable income under the mentioned clause is calculated as follows:\n\nFor the first previous year in which the sum is received for the first time under the policy, the taxable income is computed using the formula A – B:\n\nA = the sum received during the first previous year\n\nB = the aggregate of premiums paid during the policy’s term until the date of sum receipt in the first previous year, minus any premiums not claimed as deductions under Indian income tax\n\nFor subsequent previous years following the first year of sum receipt, the taxable income is calculated using the formula C – D:\n\nC = the sum received under the life insurance policy during the subsequent previous year.\n\nD = the aggregate of premiums paid during the policy’s term until the date of sum receipt in the subsequent previous year, excluding premiums claimed as deductions under other provisions of the Act or included in amounts ‘B’ or ‘D’ of this rule in any previous years\n\nThe above can be explained with the below example (illustrative only):\n\nAmendment in the Rule relating to valuation of RFA.\n\nThe Finance Act, 2023 introduced amendments to streamline the valuation mechanism for company owned accommodation provided by employer (other than Central Government or State Government employers) to employees. Now, the CBDT has revised the rule as below:\n\nFurther, if an employee consistently receives the same company owned accommodation for over a year, it has been notified now that the subsequent year valuation will not exceed the first year’s (defined as 2023-24 or the fiscal year in which the accommodation was provided, whichever is later) value adjusted using the CII. Accordingly, taxable value of RFA in the following year will be the lesser of.\n\nAdjusted first year’s value = first year’s value * CII of the subsequent year / CII of the first year.\n\nNotably the amendments to rules are effective from 1 September 2023. Hence, valuation before 1 September 2023 will continue based on the existing rules.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe CBDT clarifies the mechanism of computing the exemption in respect of amounts received as maturity proceeds or bonus from the life insurance policies. This provides the required clarity specially with detailed examples, helping individuals having high premium multiple policies in computing the amount of eligible exemption and amount taxable.\n\nThe rationalisation of rules in respect of valuation of RFA provided by the employer to employee comes as a respite as this brings down the taxable value of RFA in the wake of rising inflation. The linking of the valuation with the CII is a scientific way of valuation avoiding the requirements of rate rationalisation in future. This will help employees who are using employer owned accommodation for longer period as the taxable value will not exceed the first year’s valuation, adjusted with the CII. However, this seem to be currently limited to accommodations owned by employers. Extending this for employers’ rented accommodations shall bring the valuations of all types of RFA at par.\n\nEnabling correction by taxpayers directly using their online login account at tax filing portal for any errors in tax payment challans is a welcome step from CBDT. It’s common for taxpayers at times to input wrong assessment year while filling the tax payment challans and face challenges in getting the same corrected. This will ease the process as they can apply the correction of challan online using their online portal within the prescribed timeline.\n\nHow we can help\n\n\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

The agreement outlines a clear focus on positioning Germany as an attractive destination for skilled migration while simultaneously emphasizing a more regulated and secure immigration framework. Currently, Germany faces a projected shortfall of over 7 million skilled workers by 2035. In 2023 alone, nearly 1.9 million job vacancies were reported, with acute shortages in engineering, healthcare, IT, and skilled trades. At the same time, only around 40,000 individuals entered Germany via the skilled worker route in 2022—well below the level needed to sustain economic growth.

These regulations will require certain filers to e-file beginning in 2024. T.D. 9972 affects filers of partnership returns, corporate income tax returns, unrelated business income tax returns, withholding tax returns, certain information returns, registration statements, disclosure statements, notifications, actuarial reports and certain excise tax returns. The final regulations reflect changes made by the Taxpayer First Act (TFA) to increase e-filing without undue hardship on taxpayers.\n\nSpecifically, the final regulations:\n\nKentucky\n\nKentucky enacted legislation that reduces the personal income tax rate from 4.5% to 4.0% effective for tax years beginning after 2023.\n\nLouisiana\n\nThe Louisiana Department of Revenue released Information Bulletin No. 23-010 detailing its newly enacted “Fresh Start Proper Worker Classification Initiative” (Fresh Start Program). The program, enacted via R.S. 47:1576.3 and effective January 1, 2023, allows employers who have been misclassifying a class or classes of workers as independent contractors to reclassify those workers and voluntarily disclose such reclassification to the Department without liability for prior tax periods.\n\nTo qualify, the employer must have consistently treated all workers in the same class as non- employees for the last three years, treated all workers in the same class similarly, and have filed all IRS Forms 1099-NEC (or the predecessor IRS Form 1099-MISC) for all workers in the class. Employers are disqualified from seeking relief under the program if employers treated workers as employees by withholding income taxes or making unemployment or unemployment insurance contributions for the worker. Qualifying businesses must submit an application for the Fresh Start Program, found on the Department’s website, to the Department between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nFor tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the Massachusetts personal income tax generally conforms to the IRC as amended on January 1, 2022. The Massachusetts personal income tax previously conformed to the IRC as amended on January 1, 2005. As a result of this update announced on January 25, 2023, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022 through tax years beginning on or before December 31, 2025, Massachusetts will no longer allow most chapter 62 taxpayers to either (i) exclude qualified moving expense reimbursements from their Massachusetts gross income or (ii) deduct qualified moving expenses.\n\nDuring that period, this deduction and this exclusion will be available only to qualifying members of the Armed Forces. Qualifying members of the Armed Forces may not deduct moving expenses covered by reimbursements received from the government (or paid for directly by the government) that are excluded from their Massachusetts gross income.\n\nPennsylvania (Philadelphia)\n\nPhiladelphia now requires an employer of 50 or more employees to provide a mass transit and bicycle commuter benefit program. The bill took effect December 31, 2022 and requires one of the following:\n\n1. Standard pre-tax mass transit expense or qualified bicycle expense funded through payroll deductions. This must be consistent with the Internal Revenue Code at benefit levels at least equal to the maximum amount that may be deducted for such programs.\n\n2. Employer-paid standard tax-free transit benefit. This option requires an employer supply a Fare Instrument, such as pre-paid vouchers or cards, for an employee’s mass transit expense. Again, this must be offered at benefit levels at least equal to the maximum amount that may be deducted for such program.\n\n3. Any combination of the aforementioned two options. This means employers can offer both pre-tax transit benefits, pre-tax bike benefits, and an employer-paid tax-free transit benefit.\n\nThe ordinance defines qualified bicycle expenses as the “purchase, maintenance, repair, and storage expenses related to bicycle commuting.” Employers are required to provide instructional and informational materials about the programs they plan to offer to their employees for their review.

Code §9-6000, et seq.)\n\nHow we can help\n\nVialto can assist clients with a variety of payroll and employment tax considerations including support in determining how recent federal, state, and local legislative employment tax updates may impact the organization’s payroll and ensure employers are in compliance.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global\nnetwork.

        "date": "February 17, 2025",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nSummary\n\nFor several years, the wage withholding tax regime for Research and Development (R&D) activities in Belgium has been regularly adjusted, evolving to a more harmonized application of the tax benefit and compliance with\nlegal requirements. As you may have heard, 2025 marks a new stage with substantial modifications introduced by BELSPO, this in coordination and agreement with the Belgian tax authorities.\n\nThe 2025 BELSPO update builds further on the insights from Circular 2023/C/49 and the 2024 directives, while incorporating clarifications and aiming to enhance legal clarity and security for companies declaring R&D projects in this context.\n\nThe detail\n\nMandatory prior registration and non bis in idem\n\n*Copies or annual re-registrations are no longer accepted, except in cases of significant, duly justified adjustments.\n\n*Updates to existing registrations remain possible, but the registration of projects or programs with minor modifications will be regarded as “repetition” and cannot lead to a new tax exemption.\n\nComparison with 2024 directives\n\nClear and descriptive titles mandatory for projects\n\nComparison with 2024 directives\n\nClear distinction between “registrations” and “advisory requests”\n\n*Project/program qualification: Verification that the project/program falls within the scope of fundamental research, industrial research, or experimental development.\n*Researcher qualification: Validation of the diploma/degrees and competencies of the researchers involved.\n\nComparison with 2024 directives\n\nMandatory proof of modifications and increased controls\n\nComparison with 2024 directives\n\nSeparation of tax regimes: “wage withholding tax” vs. “innovation deduction”\n\n*A specific request is required for each measure.\n*However, advisory opinions obtained within the framework of the wage withholding tax exemption may be reused for the innovation deduction.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nThe BELSPO 2025 guidelines clearly introduce stricter rules, with the goal of increasing clarity and transparency. Registration becomes a more rigorous process, excluding any abusive re-registration and requiring a more structured follow-up of projects.\n\nCompanies must therefore anticipate their declarations, ensure compliance with title and description requirements, and document any project developments. Adhering to these new obligations will determine eligibility for tax benefits and necessitate more rigorous administrative management.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnton Scornea\nManager\n\nFilip Van Praet\nDirector\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "date": "January 20, 2025",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nSummary\n\nPersonal identification number, a 12-digit number issued by the Vietnam Ministry of Public Security (“MoPS”), will replace the current tax code number issued by the Vietnam tax authority for purposes of tax filing and payment. This replacement is applied to Vietnamese individual taxpayers and will take effect from 1 July 2025. Foreign taxpayers are not affected by this change at this juncture.\n\nThe detail\n\nOn 23 December 2024, the Ministry of Finance (“MoF”) issued Circular 86/2024/TT-BTC (“Circular 86”) regulating tax registration. Circular 86 provides detailed guidance on which entities and individuals in Vietnam are required to perform taxpayer registration directly with the tax authorities and the registration dossier requirements. But for the purpose of this news alert, we wish to highlight an important key update in relation to Vietnamese individual taxpayers.\n\nEffective from 1 July 2025, Vietnamese individual taxpayers will no longer need to obtain a tax code from the tax authorities for tax filing and payment purposes. Instead, their 12-digit PIN, issued by the MoPS will be used for their tax filing purposes. Similarly, the 12-digit PIN of their dependent(s) will also need to be used when claiming dependent relief. This change aims to align with the Vietnamese Government’s digital transformation initiatives. But note that a notification form (i.e. Form 05-DK- TCT issued under Circular 86) will need to submit to the provisional tax authorities notifying the usage of the 12-digit PIN. It is expected that guidance on implementation steps for Circular 86 will be issued soon.\n\nForeign taxpayers are not affected by this change at this juncture and will need to continue to submit tax code registration for them and their dependent(s) to obtain a a tax code from the provisional tax authorities.\n\nCircular 86 is effective from 6 February 2025 and will replace Circular 105/2020/TT-BTC providing guidance for tax registration promulgated by the MoF dated 3 December 2020. Although Circular 86 takes effect on 6 February 2025, the replacement of ID number issued by the MoPS will only be applicable from 1 July 2025.\n\nHow can we support\n\nVialto Partners would be pleased to assist you in meeting your employees’ tax compliance in Vietnam and are happy to meet up/arrange a call with you to discuss how best we can assist you and your employees to stay compliant in Vietnam.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nBrittany Chong \nPartner\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "date": "September 18, 2024",
        "content": "Im Jahr 1991 wurde das Jahresentgelt in den neuen Bundesländern im Sozialversicherungsausweis der DDR vermerkt. Ab 1992 galt dort das Meldeverfahren zur Sozialversicherung, und das Rechtskreiskennzeichen wurde aufgrund unterschiedlicher Rechengrößen in Ost- und Westdeutschland eingeführt. Mit dem Rentenüberleitungs-Abschlussgesetz von 2017 wurde beschlossen, dass ab dem 1. Januar 2025 ein einheitliches Rentenrecht für ganz Deutschland gelten sollte. Die erste Erhöhung der gesetzlichen Renten auf Basis dieser Rechengrößen fand am 1. Juli 2024 statt. Dennoch blieben Unterschiede im DEÜV-Meldeverfahren und im Beitragsnachweisverfahren bestehen, um die korrekte Rentenberechnung zu gewährleisten.\n\nAb dem 1. Januar 2025 sind im DEÜV-Meldeverfahren keine Ab- und Anmeldungen aufgrund der Beendigung der Rechtskreistrennung erforderlich. In den Meldungen ist kein Rechtskreiskennzeichen mehr anzugeben; stattdessen wird im Feld „KENNZ-RECHTSKREIS“ die Grundstellung verwendet. Für Meldezeiträume bis zum 31. Dezember 2024 bleibt die Angabe von „West“ oder „Ost“ erforderlich, auch für Stornierungen und Jahresmeldungen für 2024, die bis zum 17. Februar 2025 abgegeben werden müssen. Softwareanbieter werden die notwendigen Anpassungen in ihre Programme integrieren, und das\nSV-Meldeportal wird ebenfalls aktualisiert.\n\nIm Beitragsnachweisverfahren bleibt die Kennzeichnung des Rechtskreises auch nach dem 1. Januar 2025 notwendig. Diese Kennzeichnung ist wichtig für die Berechnung des Bundeszuschusses 2025 und für statistische Zwecke in der Rentenversicherung. Beschäftigungen in den alten Bundesländern werden\nweiterhin mit „West“ und solche in den neuen Bundesländern mit „Ost“ gekennzeichnet.\n\n\n\nIn 1991, the annual salary in the new federal states was noted in the social security card. From 1992, the social security registration procedure applied there and the legal district code was introduced due to different calculation variables in East and West Germany. With the Pensions Transition Act of 2017, it was decided that a uniform pension law should apply throughout Germany from 1 January 2025. The first increase in statutory pensions based on these calculation variables took place on 1 July 2024. Nevertheless, differences remained in the DEÜV notification procedure and the contribution statement\nprocedure in order to ensure the correct calculation of pensions.\n\nFrom 1 January 2025, no deregistrations and registrations will be required in the DEÜV notification procedure due to the end of the legal district separation. The legal district code no longer needs to be entered in the notifications; instead, the default position will be used in the ‘KENNZ-RECHTSKREIS’ field. For reporting periods up to 31 December 2024, the specification of ‘West’ or ‘East’ remains required, including for cancellations and annual reports for 2024, which must be submitted by 17 February 2025. Software providers will integrate the necessary adjustments into their programmes and the SV reporting\nportal will also be updated.\n\nIn the contribution statement procedure, the identification of the legal group will remain necessary after 1 January 2025. This labelling is important for calculating the 2025 federal subsidy and for statistical purposes in pension insurance. Employment in the old federal states will continue to be labelled as ‘West’ and employment in the new federal states as ‘East’.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the situation and provide any relevant updates.\n\nContact your Vialto Partners contact, or one of us in the information below if you have any queries about this update, or would like to discuss any other business immigration and mobility issues.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nUlrich Buschermöhle\nDirector – Global Social Security Services\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here:www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

Eligible individuals will also be able to apply for TPS-related employment authorization documents (EAD) and travel permission also known as advance parole (AP) during this time.\n\nDHS, in a related announcement has suspended certain F-1 nonimmigrant regulatory rules for Lebanese students who may be experiencing economic hardships due to the ongoing situation in Lebanon, allowing them to apply for employment authorization, work an increased number of hours while school is in session, and reduce their course load while maintaining F-1 nonimmigrant status.\n\nThe detail\n\nIn the Federal Register (FR) Notice, published November 27, 2024, the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) has designated Lebanon for TPS for the 18 month period beginning November 27, 2024, and running through May 27, 2026. By way of background, the Secretary may designate a foreign country for TPS due to country conditions that temporarily prevent the country’s nationals from returning to their home country safely. As indicated in the FR Notice, DHS, based on input by the Department of State and other government agencies, have determined the TPS designation is warranted due to the armed conflict and the current extraordinary economic, political, and humanitarian conditions in the country. This designation allows Lebanese nationals (and individuals having no nationality who last habitually resided in Lebanon) to apply for TPS so long as they have 1) continuously resided in the United States since October 16, 2024, and 2) have been continuously physically present in the United States since November 27, 2024. During this designated period, eligible individuals are not removable from the United States, and can obtain an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) and an Advanced Parole (AP) document based on obtaining TPS status.\n\nIn an accompanying Special Student Relief (SSR) notice for F-1 students whose country of citizenship is Lebanon, DHS has suspended certain regulatory requirements so that eligible students may request employment authorization, work an increased number of hours during the school year, and reduce their course load while continuing to maintain F-1 status through the TPS designation period.

To be eligible, the individuals must file Form I-821, Application for Temporary Protected Status, with appropriate fees (or request for fee waiver via Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver) with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) within the designated registration period of November 27, 2024 through May 27, 2026.

        "date": "May 3, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nEuropean Union | Suspension of Consular Support for Ukrainians and Temporary Protection Directive\n\nSummary\n\nThe Ukrainian government has suspended consular services abroad for military-age men residing outside of Ukraine. This stop on the provision of consular services will not affect the beneficiaries of the Temporary Protection Directive, according to Commission sources. However, EU employers should ensure the impacted group have the official member-state documents to prove their status.\n\nThe detail\n\nBackground\n\nThe Temporary Protection Directive was for the first time triggered by the Council in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The Temporary Protection Directive is in force until 4 March 2025 and seeks to provide immediate and temporary protection to those fleeing the Ukrainian territory. The Temporary Protection Directive has been implemented EU-wide and, through various national implementation mechanisms, has provided the beneficiaries with the rights guaranteed under the Directive, including work rights.\n\nOn 23 April, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba confirmed that the suspension of the consular services abroad for men subject to conscription, except those intended to support a return to Ukraine. This is intended to boost conscription efforts and incentivise return to Ukraine. This week has seen local embassies roll out the new policy in practice.\n\nPractical implications\n\nIn light of these developments, the Commission representative Anitta Hipper has confirmed that the Directive shall continue to apply to the beneficiaries of the Temporary Protection Directive regardless of their gender or conscription status.\n\nIn practice, however, the beneficiaries of the Temporary Protection Directive may need to resort to other local documentation remedies in order to be able to prove their status under the Directive. For example, where member states have opted to provide proof of the status under the Temporary Protection Directive in the beneficiaries’ valid passports, beneficiaries may need to seek assistance from the host member state’s authorities in order to ensure that an alternative valid proof of their protected status can be provided when the passport expires.\n\nIn addition, the suspension of consular services for military-age men residing in the European Union also means that services such as passport renewals and document procurement will no longer be possible. For those whose passports have expired or those who cannot retrieve the passports from the local consular posts, as a result of the implementation of the measure, this means that their cross-border movement may be limited.\n\nEmployers\n\nNext to the immediate protection and other rights, the Temporary Protection Directive also provides the beneficiaries with the right to work. Numerous employers in the EU have made use of the possibility to employ beneficiaries of the Temporary Protection Directive based on the proof of the protection status in their respective host member states.\n\nIn light of the above developments, it is advisable that EU employers who are employing beneficiaries of the Temporary Protection Directive take steps to ensure that affected employees are still able to provide evidence of their protected status in accordance with the official regulations of the member states.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nRaj Mann \nDirector\n\nHugo Vijge\nDirector\n\nMarijan Vrhovac\nSenior Associate\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Norway | Immigration | Immigration information for UK citizens",
        "date": "March 3, 2023",
        "content": "February 2023\n\nWith this update we would like to share some information which is applicable when UK citizens visit Norway as business travellers. Even though British citizens have not been considered as EU citizens since Brexit, there has been an increase of questions relating to this nationality, which we believe is due to the circumstance that travel frequency has stabilised post Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nSummary\n\n● Vialto Partners in Norway have noticed that travel patterns and frequency have stabilised post Covid-19 restrictions, and that a lot of UK citizens and their non-EU employers are not fully aware of the restrictions that apply for immigration to Norway post Brexit.\n● As UK citizens are categorised as non-EU according to the Norwegian Immigration Act, relevant immigration requirements must be assessed and met prior to entering Norway for business reasons.\n\nThe detail\n\nOur experience is that UK citizens are more frequently asked about their intent of stay when entering Norway. The reason for this is that UK citizens are no longer EU citizens.\n\nThe ordinary immigration legislation applies for UK citizens, meaning that an UK citizen cannot start working in Norway before a residence permit for work purposes is applied for and granted by the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI).\n\nHowever, a foreign national can work or exercise business activities without a residence permit for a short duration of time if certain requirements are met. Commercial and business travellers (people who are to participate in meetings, conferences, contract negotiations) are exempted from the residence permit requirement when visiting Norway for up to 90 days during a 180 days period as long as their activity while in Norway is limited to the planning, reporting, presentation and handover of results/products and discussion at a more general level relating to a contract or project. It is further a requirement that the business traveller do not have an employer in Norway.\n\nThe commercial and business traveller exemption also covers persons in managerial positions who are to establish a branch or other commercial presence in Norway on behalf of a service provider based abroad.\n\nWhat this means\n\nTravels to Norway which are not in compliance with the above (or any other exemptions as set out in the Immigration Regulations) are considered as work in Norway, and a residence permit for work purposes must be applied for and granted before the foreign national starts working in Norway.\n\nNon-compliance with the exemption may lead to rejection of entry. Working in Norway without a residence permit or without meeting the conditions for an exemption may lead to stricter sanctions, such as expulsion from Norway and the Schengen area for a further defined period of time.\n\nHow we can help\n\nVialto Partners recommend that non-EU companies with UK and other non-EU business travellers make a legal assessment of the stay before entering Norway, and that this assessment is documented. We further recommend that the business traveller carry this document upon entry.\n\nVialto Partners in Norway would be happy to assist with the above.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Canada | Immigration | Canada announces cap to study permits and limit foreign workers and their spouse’s eligibility for work permits",
        "date": "September 23, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration Minister Marc Miller and Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault have announced\nsignificant new measures for international students, post graduate workers and spouses of\nstudents and foreign workers to better align with Canada’s immigration objectives and in response\nto ongoing concerns about rising unemployment rates among Canadians.\n\nThese changes are intended to meet the Government of Canada’s immigration level\nplanning goals for temporary residents for over next three years along with a focus on\nproviding more employment opportunities for Canadians and newcomers to Canada. The\ngoal is also to better prepare students and workers who are seeking to enter the Canadian\nlabour market.\n\nThe following changes will be implemented by the Canadian government, with\ndirect impact on applicants for study permits, post graduate work permits and the\nspouses of international students and foreign workers :\n\n1. New language requirement for post-graduation work permit applicants: Effective\nNovember 1, 2024, any applicant for a post-graduate work permit will be required to complete a language test and meet Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) Level 7 for a University graduate and Level 5 for a College graduate.\n\n2. Limits on Post graduation work permit eligibility: Effective November 1, 2024,\npost-graduation work permit eligibility for any prospective student will depend on their level\nof study and program of study. For bachelor’s, master’s and doctorate programs, students\nwill be eligible for a work permit of up to three years. For public college program graduates,\nstudents will only be eligible for a work permit (valid for up to 3 years) if there is a labour\nshortage in Canada in their field of study.\n\n3. Cap on Study Permits: The Government of Canada will reduce the number of study\npermits to be issued for 2025 and 2026 by 10% as compared to 2024, thus capping the\nnumber of study permits issued to 437,000 study permits for 2025 and 2026.\n\n4. Limit on Student Exemption from the Cap on Study Permits: As of 2025, master’s and\ndoctorate students will be subject to the cap on study permits. Also, the government has\nreserved 12% of the cap for graduate students, which aligns with Canada’s economic goals\nand post graduate work permit limits and updates.\n\n5. Open Spousal Work Permit Eligibility Limits for Spouses of Students: There will be\nlimits on the issuance of open work permits for spouses of international students who are\nenrolled in doctorate programs, certain master’s programs, select professional programs,\nand certain pilot programs. Further details will be released in the near future.\n\n6. Open Spousal Work Permit Eligibility Limits for Spouses of Foreign Workers: There\nwill be limits on the issuance of open work permits to spouses of foreign workers. Only\nspouses of highly skilled, specialized workers such as C-suite executives, scientists,\nengineers, lawyers, professors and technicians, or of workers in sectors where there are\nkey labour shortages will be eligible for open spousal work permits. However, spouses of\nforeign workers in critical labour shortage sectors, such as health care and construction, will\nremain eligible for an open spousal work permit. Further details will be released in the near\nfuture.\n\nThis announcement is aligned with and comes following a series of government announcements aimed at reducing the number of temporary residents in Canada:\n\n● Reducing Canada’s temporary resident population to 5% over the next three years\n● Reducing off-campus work hours to 20 hours per week, pending the roll-out of a 24 hour per\nweek work authorization for fall of 2024\n● Introducing a cap on the number of international students admitted to Canada to provide better\nsupport systems – such as housing and job opportunities – and to prepare them to integrate into\nCanadian society\n\nIn addition, the Canadian government is expected to announce their annual immigration level plans for the next three years (2025 to 2027) by November 1, 2024.\n\nThe above changes currently impact prospective international students and their spouses, post\ngraduate work permit applicants and their spouses, and the spouses of foreign workers.\n\nAs the Government of Canada continues to review their broader immigration goals, additional changes are expected in the coming months. This could include further restrictions on work permit\neligibility for the spouses of international students and foreign workers in Canada.\n\nWhen making a job offer to an international graduate of a Canadian post-secondary institution,\nemployers should verify that such graduates hold valid post-graduate work permits.\n\nOnce the new spousal work permit eligibility criteria has been released, employers may also\nwant to review their current foreign worker population to determine whether any current foreign\nworkers will encounter issues in renewing work permits for their spouses.\n\nFor further details regarding this, or any other immigration matter, please contact a\nmember of our team at Vialto Partners LLP.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto\nPartners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nNadine Landry \nPartner\n\nMelodie Molina \nPartner\n\nSusan Martyn \nPartner\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here:www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

L’objectif est également de mieux préparer les étudiants et les\ntravailleurs qui entrent sur le marché du travail canadien.\n\nLes changements suivants seront mis en œuvre par le gouvernement canadien, avec un impact\ndirect sur les demandeurs de permis d’études, de permis de travail post-diplôme et sur les\nconjoints d’étudiants étrangers et de travailleurs étrangers :\n\n1. Nouvelle exigence linguistique pour les demandeurs de permis de travail\npost-diplôme : à compter du 1er novembre 2024, tout demandeur de permis de travail\npost-diplôme devra satisfaire à l’exigence de compétence linguistique du niveau 7 du\nNiveau de compétence linguistique canadien (NCLC) pour un diplômé universitaire et du\nniveau 5 pour un diplômé collégial.\n\n2. Limites d’admissibilité au permis de travail post-diplôme : à compter du 1er\nnovembre 2024, l’admissibilité au permis de travail post-diplôme pour tout étudiant\npotentiel dépendra de son niveau d’études et de son programme d’études. Pour les\nprogrammes de baccalauréat, de maîtrise et de doctorat, l’étudiant sera admissible à un\npermis de travail d’une durée maximale de trois ans. Pour les diplômés des programmes\ncollégiaux publics, ils ne seront admissibles à un permis de travail d’une durée maximale\nde trois ans que s’il y a une pénurie de main-d’œuvre au Canada dans leur domaine\nd’études.\n\n3. Plafond des permis d’études : Le gouvernement du Canada réduira de 10 % le\nnombre de permis d’études à délivrer pour les années 2025 et 2026 par rapport à 2024,\nlimitant ainsi la délivrance de permis d’études à 437 000 permis d’études seulement\npour 2025 et 2026.\n\n4. Limite de l’exemption des étudiants du plafond des permis d’études : À partir de\n2025, les étudiants de maîtrise et de doctorat seront soumis au plafond des permis\nd’études. De plus, le gouvernement a réservé 12 % du plafond aux étudiants diplômés\nafin de s’aligner sur leurs objectifs économiques et sur les limites et mises à jour des\npermis de travail post-diplôme.\n\n5. Limites d’admissibilité au permis de travail ouvert pour les conjoints d’étudiants :\nIl y aura des limites à la délivrance de permis de travail ouverts pour les conjoints\nd’étudiants étrangers inscrits à des programmes de doctorat, à certains programmes de\nmaîtrise, à certains programmes professionnels et à certains programmes pilotes. De\nplus amples informations à ce sujet seront fournies ultérieurement.\n\n6. Limites d’admissibilité au permis de travail ouvert pour les conjoints de\ntravailleurs étrangers : Des limites seront imposées à la délivrance de permis de travail\nouvert pour les conjoints de travailleurs étrangers. Seuls les conjoints de travailleurs\nhautement qualifiés et spécialisés, comme les cadres supérieurs, les scientifiques, les\ningénieurs, les avocats, les professeurs et les techniciens, ou de travailleurs dans des\nsecteurs où il existe des pénuries de main-d’œuvre importantes, seront admissibles à un\npermis de travail ouvert pour les conjoints. Toutefois, les conjoints de travailleurs\nétrangers dans des secteurs où la pénurie de main-d’œuvre est critique, comme les\nsoins de santé et la construction, resteront admissibles à un permis de travail ouvert\npour les conjoints.\n\nCette annonce reflète les déclarations publiées plus tôt ce mois-ci et intervient peu de temps\naprès celles-ci, concernant plusieurs mesures que le gouvernement envisage de mettre en\nœuvre, notamment\n\n● La réduction de la population de résidents temporaires du Canada à 5 % au\ncours des trois prochaines années\n● Les heures de travail hors campus des étudiants ont été ramenées à 20 heures,\nen attendant la mise en œuvre de 24 heures à l’automne de cette année\n● Le plafonnement du nombre d’étudiants étrangers afin de leur offrir un meilleur\nsystème de soutien, comme le logement, les possibilités d’emploi et de les\npréparer à s’intégrer à la société canadienne\n\nEn outre, le gouvernement canadien annoncera ses plans annuels en matière de niveaux\nd’immigration pour les trois prochaines années (2025 à 2027) d’ici le 1er novembre 2024.\n\nLes changements ci-dessus ont actuellement un impact sur les futurs étudiants étrangers et\nleurs conjoints, les demandeurs de permis de travail post-diplôme et leurs conjoints ainsi que\nles conjoints de travailleurs étrangers.\n\nAlors que le gouvernement du Canada continue de revoir ses objectifs plus larges en matière\nd’immigration, des ajustements supplémentaires peuvent être attendus dans les mois à venir.\nCela pourrait inclure des informations supplémentaires sur les exigences relatives à\nl’admissibilité des conjoints d’étudiants étrangers.\n\nLorsqu’ils font une offre d’emploi à un diplomé international, les employeurs doivent vérifier que\nle candidat détient un permis de travail post-diplôme valide.\n\nUne fois que les critères d’éligibilité au permis de travail pour conjoints seront publiés, les\nemployeurs voudront également s’assurer que leurs travailleurs étrangers en emploi ne feront\npas face à des problèmes pour renouveler le permis de travail ouvert de leur conjoint.\n\nPour plus de détails à ce sujet ou sur toute autre question d’immigration,\nveuillez contacter un membre de notre équipe chez Vialto Partners LLP.\n\nContactez-nous\nPour plus dʼinformations sur ce qui précède, veuillez contacter un membre de notre équipe chez Vialto\nAssociés, ou alternativement:\n\nNadine Landry \nAssociée\n\nMelodie Molina \nAssociée\n\nSusan Martyn \nAssociée\n\nDe plus amples informations sur Vialto Partners sont disponibles ici: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners et/ou Vialto Associés (« Vialto ») fait référence aux filiales détenues en propriété exclusive de CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited ainsi qu’aux autres membres du réseau mondial Vialto Partners.

        "title": "Singapore | Employment Tax | Budget 2023 – A Vialto Viewpoint",
        "date": "February 24, 2023",
        "content": "14 February 2023\n\nSingapore | Budget 2023 – A Vialto Viewpoint\n\nThe Backdrop\n\nThe Singapore Budget 2023 was highly anticipated as it was expected to lay out the future plans for preparing Singapore to excel in the post-pandemic world, while at the same time, helping Singaporeans deal with rising inflation costs, slower economic growth and Goods and Services Tax (GST) hikes.\n\nOverall, the Budget 2023 proposals ensure that Singaporeans – especially in the lower and middle income segment are given the necessary support to tide over the uncertainties in the post pandemic era, while preparing Singapore for the future by attracting investments and building capabilities in a world where countries are shifting from prioritizing mutual gains to national security.\n\nKey fiscal measures focused on workforce and new ways of working\n\nBuilding a robust retirement nest for an ageing population\n\n1. Continued increase of Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution rates for senior employees\n\nFrom 1 January 2024, for older workers aged 55 to 70, the Government will continue with a third round of increase in CPF contribution rates, and provide employers with CPF transition offsets as per the previous two raises.\n\n2. Increase in CPF contribution for Platform Workers and Platform Companies\n\nFrom late 2024, the CPF contribution rates for Platform Workers below age of 30 and Platform Companies will be aligned to those of regular employees and employers over a phase-in period of five years. Older Platform Workers can also opt-in for this scheme. To help the Platform Workers earning S$2,500 or less a month, CPF Transition Support will also be introduced to cushion the cash-flow impact on their take-home pay.\n\nIn addition, Platform Companies will be required to insure the workers to the same level that employees are covered under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA).\n\nThese changes will certainly present increase in business costs to Platform Companies. These companies will be looking at the Committee of Supply (COS) debate in the hope that there will be some Government support similar to the CPF transition offset for senior workers. Another aspect that needs clarity is the downstream opt-in facility, for example whether both the Platform Workers and Platform Companies need to mutually agree to the opt-in.\n\n3. CPF monthly salary ceiling would be progressively increased to S$8,000 by 2026\n\n\n\n1 Sep 2023\n\n\n\n1 Jan 2024\n\n\n\n1 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n1 Jan 2026\n\nWhile there is currently no change to the annual salary ceiling, from the employee’s perspective, this update provides more certainty regarding their CPF contribution amount (and in turn CPF relief), regardless of their pay structure.\n\nFor example, an employee with monthly salary of S$7,500 with no Additional Wages (AW) component would now benefit from the higher CPF contributions (S$6,300 – S$6,000 * 37% = S$111 per month).\n\nFrom the employer’s perspective, besides the possible increase in business costs, employers would need to consider various implications from the payroll administration standpoint, as follows:-\n\nFor example, where bonus (AW) paid in January 2023 was subject to the capping of S$30,000, due to the increase in monthly capping to S$6,300 from September 2023, the total AW cap allowable will be reduced to S$28,800 for calendar year 2023. As such, more guidance is required from the CPF Board if the refund application is required, if there will be automatic refund from the CPF Board or there can be lower CPF contribution in the month of December, taking into account the overall capping of S$102,000.\n\nFor bonus that has not been paid yet, it is important that the payroll system is adjusted to capture the change and corresponding AW capping.\n\nProviding Support to Young Families\n\n1.  Fixed Dollar Relief for Working Mother’s Child Relief (WMCR)\n\nFor eligible working mothers with children born on and after 1 January 2024, the WMCR will no longer be claimed based on a percentage of the mother’s earned income. This change will ensure the lower to middle income group of working mothers will be entitled to fixed amounts of relief, which they would otherwise not be eligible.\n\nBy way of illustration, before this change, a working mother with an annual income of S$40,000 could only claim tax relief of S$6,000 on her first child. With the fixed dollar relief, she will now be eligible to claim for an enhanced tax relief of S$8,000. This enhanced relief will be enjoyed for additional children as well.\n\n\n\nWorking Mother with Earned Income of S$40,000 – current entitlements\n\nThe measure will benefit working mothers with yearly income up to S$53,300 (depending on the number of children), which is again in line with the Government’s progressive direction to provide more support to the lower to middle income group of taxpayers, while potentially increasing tax revenue from the high income working mothers.\n\n2.  Paternity Leave doubled to four weeks\n\nGovernment-paid paternity leave will be increased to four weeks for eligible working fathers with children born on and after 1 January 2024. Such grant of additional leave, while optional for employers to start with, will be made mandatory in due course to ensure fathers are involved in the care of their children, especially in the early days. While employers who grant the additional two weeks of leave will be duly reimbursed (subject to capping), they should consider workforce planning in view of the longer absence of such employees.\n\n3. Foreign Domestic Worker Levy Tax Relief will be withdrawn from Year of Assessment (YA) 2025\n\nThe withdrawal of this relief has been proposed in view of the fact that many Singaporean families already benefit from the domestic worker levy concession. This withdrawal will undoubtedly impact working mothers, and more so those who do not qualify for the domestic worker levy concession, but is intended to allow the government to channel targeted support for eligible families who need help caring for their dependents.\n\n4. Relaxed condition on eligibility for Grandparent Caregiver Relief (GCR)\n\nPrior to this change, working mothers could only claim GCR if the caregivers had no income. With effect from YA 2024, such claims will be permissible, provided the caregivers’ income does not exceed S$4,000 in the year preceding the YA of claim.\n\nBuilding a Giving Society\n\nThe weighted tax deduction of 250% for qualifying donations will be extended for another three years till the end of 2026, and will be reviewed thereafter. This move will be welcomed, and it reinforces the Government’s commitment to foster the spirit of giving, to build a gracious and caring society.\n\nEncouraging Flexible Working Arrangements\n\nThe Tripartite Standard on Flexi-work arrangements will be implemented in 2024. Such roll-out will require employers to consider staff requests for such arrangements fairly and properly. This move underlines the Government’s supportive stand for flexible working arrangements.\n\nThis move is expected to be embraced by most employees, however, employees would wish for more definitive and easy to claim relief to offset their rising costs from working from home. Currently, there are allowable deductions for incremental home office expenses such as electricity charges and telecommunication charges which can be difficult to ascertain. Instead, a fixed work from home deduction on a per day basis could be introduced.\n\nFrom the employers’ standpoint, considering that flexible work arrangements would be a norm in future, they could consider implementing a formal flexible working policy to provide greater clarity to their employees as well as people managers and HR practitioners around new ways of working.\n\nIn closing\n\nBudget 2023’s main focus is to provide assurance and support to local Singaporeans, especially lower and middle income families, and it delivers on this front. The Minister of Finance has indeed offered a nice Valentine Day present to many households, as promised ahead of his Budget Speech.\n\nWhile the Budget announcements have to be lauded for being forward looking and focused, we were hoping that more could have been done in the following areas:\n\n\n\nWhile taking care of the local population, it is a big part of the Budget 2023 to focus on ensuring Singapore remains relevant and competitive on the global stage, in the face of global competition and challenge to small economies such as Singapore. It is therefore imperative to attract investments and global talent to our shores which in turn will create job opportunities for local Singaporeans in the medium to long term. While there has been introduction of ONEPASS scheme earlier this year aimed at attracting top global talents, another change we were hoping to see is the re-introduction of Not Ordinarily Resident (NOR) Scheme or similar concession that would entice top talent and key executives who hold global and regional roles, to set base in Singapore. To allow a level playing field, such concession could be extended to eligible local talents as well.\n\n\n\nContact us\n\nVialto Partners provides comprehensive tax solutions, immigration services, compensation & rewards and dynamic work strategy & services to clients.

As a result, it is a country that is becoming increasingly attractive – hundreds of thousands of foreigners travel Colombia every year.\n\nIn order to enhance the security and improve the quality of life of its citizens and visitors, Colombian visa applications have changed significantly since the law came into effect. One of the most important changes is that a residency visa holder, whose resident visa was issued before October 22, 2022, must transfer/renew their visa within 2 years of the law coming into effect.\n\nActions\n\nResident visas issued before October 22, 2022 must be transferred/renewed by no later than October 22, 2024.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nHungary | Overview of Hungary’s new Golden Visa Program: Opportunities, requirements and considerations\n\nSummary\nAs of 2024, Hungary offers the possibility for individuals from third countries to obtain a Golden Visa. Officially named the Guest Investor Residence Permit, it has a validity of 10 years and also allows holders to spend up to 90 days within any 180-day period in other Schengen Area countries without an additional entry visa.\n\nThe Detail\nThis permit involves a minimum investment of either EUR 250,000 in an investment fund fulfilling the conditions specified by the immigration law or EUR 500,000 in Hungarian residential real estate, with a mandatory 5-year investment holding period.\n\nThe Guest Investor Residence Permit offers a maximum initial validity of 10 years, extendable once. Notably, individuals are not required to spend an extended period in Hungary to maintain the permit’s validity. Accommodation in Hungary during the permit’s validity is necessary but can be fulfilled through various means.\n\nObtaining the Guest Investor Residence Permit does not trigger personal income tax or social security contribution obligations automatically. However, individuals considering a longer stay in Hungary may need to address these aspects. Hungarian tax regulations can be advantageous for those with higher passive income.\n\nAcquiring Hungarian citizenship requires a residence card, not provided with the Guest Investor Residence Permit. Family members, including spouses, minor children, and dependent parents or certain relatives, can apply for a residence permit with similar benefits.\n\nThe permit allows the holder to work in Hungary without a separate approval process.

        "title": "Croatia | Employment Tax | Changes to the Personal Income Tax Act",
        "date": "August 18, 2023",
        "content": "17 August 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nNew amendments to the Personal Income Tax Act were drafted for approval by the Parliament of the Croatian Government in July 2023. It is expected that the amendments will be enacted in September this year and come into force from 1 January 2024.\n\nThe biggest change is the autonomy that will be given to local authorities in deciding the tax rates applicable on employment income, self-employment income and other income (known as annual income).\n\nOther changes include:\n• Abolition of surtax which was calculated on the income tax according to decisions of local authorities.\n• An increase in personal allowances.\n• An increase in the threshold for the application of the higher income tax rate\n• The introduction of taxation of tips received by employees from third parties (mostly affecting employees working in restaurants and bars) and\n• The equalization of tax treatment of allocation of shares regardless of the company type\n\nThe Detail\n\n(1) Tax rates and personal allowances\n\nThe main goal of the proposed amendments is to increase the autonomy of local authorities in determining tax rates. The decision of local government authorities would be required to be published in the Croatian Official Gazette, no later than the end of November of the current year and would be applied from January 1 of the following year, or until a new decision is adopted. If the representative body of the local government unit does not publish a decision within the prescribed period (i.e., no later than the end of November), tax rates of 20% and 30% would be applied (which are currently in use).\n\nFour groups are proposed based on the size of the local government unit. The following minimum and maximal tax rates that can be determined by each local government:\n\nAn increase to the higher tax brackets has also been proposed. The change would increase the\nincome level at which the higher rate of tax applies from €47,479.28 to €50,400.\n\nIt is also proposed to increase the basic personal allowance from €530.90 to €560. It is also proposed to increase the coefficients available for calculating the increased personal allowance for dependent children and members of the family with disabilities as follows:\n\n(2) Taxation of tips\n\nThe labour and tax regulations only recognise the relationship between an employer and the employed person, and the employment income paid within that relationship. Therefore, the Croatian government has decided to regulate the tax treatment of tips.\n\nIn the proposed amendments, tips are regulated in such a way that no income tax is paid based on tips paid up to the prescribed amount. The excess above the prescribed non-taxable amount would be subject to taxation at a rate of 20%. It is proposed that the tax due should be , withheld and paid by the payer by the 15th day of the month following the month in which the tips were received.\n\nThe tips are defined as receipts, based on a reward for a well-performed service, received by third parties and recorded in the fiscalization system according to a special regulation on fiscalization.\n\nThe payer is obliged to submit to the Tax Administration a report by the deadline which will be determined by the Regulation on Personal Income Tax. It is not specified, but the “payer” is likely considered to be the employer or the payer of the employment income and not the person (third party) who has paid the tip.\n\n(3) Tax treatment of shares\n\nCurrently, the unequal tax treatment of the allocation or optional purchase of own shares and business shares leads to the fact that workers employed in limited liability companies are in a disadvantageous position compared to workers employed in a joint-stock company.\n\nConsidering the rights arising from shares and business shares (i.e., their economic essence), there was a need to remove less favourable tax treatment and equalize their tax treatment.\n\nThe amendments propose that receipts in kind by the members of a company’s management board, which are realized by awarding or optionally purchasing own shares and business shares, are deemed to be capital income. The same applies also for receipts in kind which are realized by awarding or optionally purchasing own shares and business shares, which employers give to their workers.\n\nIn the explanation of the amendments, it is written that for clearer interpretation of the provisions, the article on capital income from the allocation or optional purchase of shares will be harmonized with the concept of own shares in accordance with the Law on Commercial Companies. Accordingly, the new provision will be as follows: “Income from capital from Article 64 paragraph 1 of this Act shall also include receipts of workers and members of the management board of a domestic company or natural persons not employed by the payer by awarding own shares of associated company in the country or abroad or by realising the rights from an options contract concluded with associated company in the country or abroad.”\n\nThis means that income from capital will be deemed in situations where a domestic company is giving to its employees / members of the management board shares that the company holds in an associated company abroad, but not own shares that the associated company is giving to employees of its associated company where for the cost of this allocation is not charged the employer of the employees who will receive the shares (in this situation the shares will be deemed to be other income). If a company gives shares that it owns in another associated company (not its own shares) to any natural person, this will be deemed to be income from capital.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Singapore | Rising trend of employment income audits",
        "date": "April 3, 2025",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nSummary\n\nThe Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has intensified its focus on tax compliance, leading to a noticeable uptick in employment income tax audits. These audits aim to verify the accurate reporting of employment income details under the Auto-Inclusion Scheme (AIS). This trend underscores the growing importance of understanding individual tax compliance obligations and the crucial role employers play in ensuring accurate and timely reporting.\n\nThe detail\n\nCommon reporting pitfalls\n\nAccurate and timely reporting of employment income is crucial for avoiding penalties and adhering compliance with tax regulations. Employers and employees should focus on the following areas:\n\nTaxable income\n\n\n\nawards\n\n\n\npurchase scheme (ESPP)\n\n\n\nto overseas pension fund/social security scheme\n\nCertain income components are often overlooked but remain taxable, including:\n\nEquity-based compensation\n\nWays to maintain compliance\n\nEmployers can take the following steps to ensure compliance and minimize audit risks:\n\nProactive steps to mitigate audit risks\n\nEmployers can reduce audit risks and support compliance by taking the following steps:\n\nPeriodically review payroll and AIS submissions to identify and correct discrepancies.\n\nReassess policies to ensure proper documentation and reporting of benefits and various remuneration items.\n\nOrganize key documents, including annual payroll summaries, employee handbooks, and meeting minutes approving directors’ fees, to be readily available in the event of an audit.\n\nBy addressing these areas and implementing proactive measures, employers can enhance compliance and reduce the risk of penalties or audit complications.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe rise in employment income audits underscores the need for heightened vigilance from both employees and employers. By adopting robust compliance measures, employers can reduce audit risks, safeguard employee trust, and contribute to a transparent tax environment. Proactive steps today can prevent costly errors and ensure alignment with IRAS expectations.\n\nAs we observe greater collaboration among statutory bodies, it is plausible that the CPF Board may also intensify its audits.

        "title": "Netherlands | Immigration | TPD protection status ends on 4 March 2024 for non-Ukrainian nationals, while the protection status for Ukrainian nationals remains in place",
        "date": "January 18, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nNetherlands | TPD protection status ends on 4 March 2024 for non-Ukrainian nationals, while the protection status for Ukrainian nationals remains in place\n\nSummary \nEU Temporary Protection Directive (TPD) offers protection to those fleeing the war in Ukraine, providing a legal basis for providing residence rights, shelter, medical care, work rights and education to its beneficiaries until at least 4 March 2025. When implementing the TPD on 4 March 2022, the Dutch government decided that the measures would apply equally to Ukrainian nationals as well as non-Ukrainian nationals who were residing in Ukraine at the time.\n\nHowever, from July 2022, the Dutch government has been looking to end TPD protection for non-Ukrainian nationals. A ruling by the highest competent court in the Netherlands, handed down on 17 January 2024, has now confirmed that TPD protection for non-Ukrainian nationals will end on 4 March 2024.\n\nThe Detail \nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, EU member states decided to activate the TPD to support people who left Ukraine. The TPD entered into force on 4 March 2022 and has been extended until 4 March 2025. This protection status offered immediate protection to Ukrainian nationals and a clear legal status in each Member State of the European Union. In the Netherlands, non-Ukrainian nationals were also covered by the TPD if they resided in Ukraine before 24 February 2022.\n\nIn July 2022, the Dutch Ministry of Justice and Security formally decided to end TPD protection for non-Ukrainian nationals, arguing that non-Ukrainian nationals in most cases are able to return to their country of nationality. The date set by the Dutch government was 4 September 2023, by which time non-Ukrainian holders of TPD protection in the Netherlands would either have to leave the Netherlands or apply for a different residence status. In response to this unilateral decision, several non-Ukrainian TPD status holders filed an appeal to the highest administrative court in the Netherlands, the Dutch Council of State.\n\nOn 17 January 2024, the Council of State issued its ruling based on the appeal. While it did not agree with the arbitrary date of 4 September 2023, the court confirmed that the Dutch government has the right to end protection for non-Ukrainian nationals under the TPD from 4 March 2024. This is because the TPD is extended on a yearly basis and the Dutch government communicated in July 2023 its intention to end TPD rights for non-Ukrainian nationals, which is before 19 October 2023, when the EU Council formally decided to extend the TPD until 4 March 2025. The court therefore accepts that the Dutch government was clear and timely in its intention to have the TPD extension after 4 March 2024 apply only to Ukrainian nationals.\n\nWhat this means \nAs a result of this ruling, non-Ukrainian nationals will no longer be protected under the TPD as of 4 March 2024. This means that if non-Ukrainian nationals would like to continue to reside in the Netherlands after this date, they have to obtain a different type of Dutch residency status to allow them to continue to live, work, and study in the Netherlands. Alternative options include applying under regular asylum rules or via an employer-sponsored category.\n\nThe decision of the Dutch Council of State will not affect the protection status of Ukrainian nationals under the TPD. This means that the rights to reside, including work rights, of Ukrainian nationals based on the TPD will remain in place until 4 March 2025.

        "date": "October 30, 2023",
        "content": "A new Framework Agreement on Telework has been put in place among EU/EEA countries (including Switzerland) in order to govern social security for cross-border commuters following Covid-19.\n\nPlease find further information about the agreement here: https://lnkd.in/ewnZJMsQ\n\nIt is optional for each EU/EEA county to opt into the agreement. Currently (4 October 2023) 19 countries have signed the agreement. The scope of the agreement covers teleworking in a narrow sense.\n\nDue to the narrow scope of the agreement and the fact that not all EU/EEA countries have signed, some commuter cases need to be managed according to the traditional rules on EU social security coordination.\n\nPlease find the below presentation, which showcases examples of such basic scenarios as well as how these have been solved.\n\nDespite the circumstance that the examples build on real-life cases and actual solutions, the presentation is made for discussion purposes only. As the agreement is new and variations in the applicability of the EU social security rules may be experienced in each EU/EEA country, a case-by-case assessment should always be made.\n\nThis is part 3 of our scenario insights. Please find our previous scenarios here\n\n– Part 1: https://lnkd.in/eA9xi7uu\n\n– Part 2: https://lnkd.in/enCUbp9n\n\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out to Gary Chandler, Leanne Birch, myself or your local Vialto Partners contact if you wish to discuss further.\n\nFor more information please find below the content:\n\nNew Framework Agreement for EU/EEA commuters\n\nLong-distance commuter\n\nSituation\n\n● Employer established in country A.\n\n● Employee living in country B.\n\n● Country B has not signed the New EU/EEA Framework Agreement on Commuters.\n\n● The employee is performing a long-distance commute between home and the office taking an approx 2 hour flight each way.\n\n● The employee wishes to work from home 2 days a week.\n\n● The employer is paying for the commute flight tickets.\n\nComments\n\n● The EU/EEA Framework Agreement does not apply.\n\n● The employee is covered by social security in country B if 25 % or more of the total work is performed in country B.\n\n● Traditionally, a two-day work week from home would trigger a commuter to be socially secured in country B.\n\n● However, long-distance commuters may spend substantially longer work days at the office than at home.\n\n● For example, if the employee works 3 x 10 hours at the office the employee may distribute up to 2 x 5 hours working from home without triggering social security coverage in the residence country.\n\n● Also, old EU case-law could suggest that commuting time is calculated as work in country A, if paid for by the employer.\n\n● The above always has to be looked into on a case-by-case basis, also taking into account applicable labour laws\n\nTemporary WFH commuter assignment\n\nSituation\n\n● Employer established in country A.\n\n● Employee living in country B.\n\n● Country B has not signed the EU/EEA Framework Agreement on commuters.\n\n● The employee’s main place of work is at the employer office in country A.\n\n● The employee would like to work from home 3-4 days a week for a temporary period over the next two years while having small children.\n\n● The employee and the employer concludes a temporary WFH commuter assignment agreement.\n\nComments\n\n● As a starting point the employee would be covered by social security in country B as 25 % or more of the work is being performed there.\n\n● However, if the work in country B is deemed temporary (and not permanent), a special posting provision could maintain the employee in the social security schemes of country A.\n\n● According to a recent EU guideline the posting mechanism applies when ”[t]he employee can only continue to work from home, because e.g. s/he has to care for sick children, or small children or is the partner of such a person (otherwise this employee would have e.g. to take paid or unpaid leave and would not any longer be in a position to exercise the work.”\n\n● It is unclear if this guideline applies when the employee is working partially in country B.\n\n● A case-by-case assessment has to be conducted, especially taking the practices of country A into account\n\nDelivering a temporary service\n\nSituation\n\n● Employer established in country A.\n\n● Employee living in country B.\n\n● Country A and B has signed the EU/EEA Framework Agreement on commuters.\n\n● The employees main place of work is at the employer office in country A.\n\n● The employer wins a two-year project with a customer in country B.\n\n● As the employee speaks the language in country B, the customer ask for this employee to deliver the service.\n\n● For the next two years the employee spends 40 % of the work time in country B working on the project.\n\n● A temporary assignment agreement is concluded between the employee and the employer.\n\nComments\n\n● As a starting point the employee would be covered by social security in country B as 25 % or more of the work is being performed there.\n\n● However, if the work in country B is deemed temporary (and not permanent), a special posting provision could maintain the employee in the social security schemes of country A.\n\n● According to an EU guideline, the circumstance that the relocation of the workplace is driven by the employee’s personal interests – which is often the case for workcation or work from home – does not preclude the application of the posting mechanism.\n\n● A case-by-case assessment has to be conducted, especially taking the practices of country A into account.\n\nManaging healthcare for new hires\n\nSituation\n\n● Employer established in country A.\n\n● Employee living in country B with his family.\n\n● The employee starts the employment by 1 July 2023, working 2 days a week from home.\n\n● The employee has previously been working in country B and covered by social security there.\n\n● An A1 application is filed in country A under the new EU/EEA Framework Agreement.\n\n● Following the issuance of the A1 certificate the S1 application is filed country A.\n\nComments\n\n● When the employee changes employer, the employee is now socially security in country A and no longer socially secured in country B.\n\n● Therefore, the health insurance coverage for the employee and the family members is ended.\n\n● The healthcare coverage in country B can be continued by virtue of the S1 certificate.\n\n● However, the lead times for the A1 to by issued followed by the S1 can be several months.\n\n● It is therefore important to discuss, how to ensure healthcare coverage for the employee and the family members until the S1 is in place.\n\nWe would be happy to hear from you\n\nGary Chandler\nGlobal Social Security\n+44 7796 941035\ngary.chandler@vialto.com\n\nAdam Rewucha\nNorthern Europe\n+45 21 99 64

        "title": "Spain | Employment Tax | Other amendments introduced by the Start-Ups Act",
        "date": "March 14, 2023",
        "content": "03 March 2023\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nThis bulletin summarises the changes to the income tax system introduced as result of the publication of the amendment bill to the Income Tax Regulation.\n\nNew Expatriate Regime Application Deadline\n\nOne of the stand-out changes introduced by the regulation amendment is the deadline to apply for the special regime for displaced workers who acquire tax residence in Spain in 2023. The new regulation establishes a strict six-month deadline for those who acquire residence in Spain in 2023 to communicate their decision to the Spanish Tax Office (AEAT). This will apply both to the new groups (economic activity, professionals, directors and family members) as well as the groups already covered under the previous regulation (taxpayers with a labour relationship or directors).\n\nAccordingly, It is important to keep an eye on the approval of the new communication form (i.e. Form 149), for the special regime option in order to calculate the six-month term. This will lead to the unusual situation of reactivating some situations in which communication term had already expired (e.g., if the communication was not made for a labour relationship which commenced on 1 August 2022, even though the six months has elapsed, it seems that an application can be made on approval of the new form, but we await final approval of the regulation to confirm on this point).\n\nGranting free shares or stocks to employees\n\nArticle 42.3 of the Income Tax Act establishes a tax exemption for the payment of certain benefits in kind (e.g. health insurance, travel vouchers, nursery vouchers etc.), among which paragraph (f) provides for the tax exemption for shares worth up to €12,000 granted annually to employees free of a charge. An amendment introduced in 2014 greatly reduced the application of this tax allowance, given that up to that time it required that the granting of shares formed part of the company’s general remuneration policy. However, as of 2015, the regulation requires that the offer of shares be made under the same conditions for all company employees.\n\nIn the case of start-ups (a concept defined in the Start-ups Act, specifically Article 3 of Law 28/2022), the new regulation raises the ceiling value of these free shares granted to employees to €50,000 annually and makes the provision more flexible by establishing that it is sufficient that the shares granted form part of the company’s general remuneration policy.\n\nAnother noteworthy modification is that if the shares are granted owing to the exercise of a stock option, it is required that the company is classified as a start-up at the time the stock options are granted and not at the time they are exercised by the employee.\n\nHow stock-options are treated in start-ups\n\nThe new income tax regulation that applies to the acquisition of shares via stock options in start-ups has sought to adapt to this remuneration system and make it attractive to these types of companies by means of the following measures:\n⮚ The tax exemption ceiling is increased from €12,000 to €50,000 a year.\n⮚ The company must be classified as a start-up at the time that stock options are granted. It does not matter that the company is no longer classified as a start-up at the time the stock option is exercised and the shares are acquired.\n⮚ The process for determining the price of the shares where the company is unlisted is made easier. The value of the shares paid up by an independent third party in the last capital increase during the course of the previous year, or the market value if there has been none in the last year, is accepted as the share price.\n⮚ Ten-year deferral to pay income tax on labour earnings from the stock options, except where the actions have been admitted to trading on the market or the employee has transferred the shares.\n\nDeduction for investments in newly or recently created companies\n\nIn a previous reform of the income tax system, a deduction was introduced for investments in new companies. Under this new reform of the Income Tax Act caused by the Start-ups Act, the deduction percentage has been raised from 30% to 50% as has the exemption base from €60,000 to €100,000. Moreover, the term for investing in start-ups has been increased to seven years from its creation. Non-resident investors who become directors can choose to sign up to the expatriate regime. Furthermore, foreign investors are no longer required to hold a Foreign Resident’s Card and can now get a tax number via a simplified online procedure.\n\nTaxing carried interest tax\n\nCarried interest is a performance fee. In other words, it is a share in the profits earned by general partners or private equity, venture or hedge fund managers.\n\nA question that has arisen in recent years revolves around whether this is considered a manner of remunerating dependent work or, if this is remuneration for the taking-on of a capital risk in which the taxpayer is involved in its management. This determination results in a significant difference in the applicable tax rate.\n\nThe Directorate-General for Taxes (DG) has always held in its decisions to referrals that it constitutes labour earnings (a 47% marginal rate), as opposed to other countries where carried interest is considered to be capital income or how it is treated in some regional autonomies.\n\nThe new regulation has opted for a compromise solution. Carried interest is to be regarded as labour earnings and will form part of the general tax base (as held by the DGT), but it will only be calculated on 50% of the amount (thus treating the tax cost as savings income).\n\nHowever, certain doubts arise as to the literal purport of the wording as outlined below albeit exercising due caution. A closer look at the regulation wording (Paragraph 3 of Additional Provision 53) is below:\n\n“The labour earnings referred to in paragraph 1 (carried interest) shall be calculated on a taxable base of 50% of the amount in question, without any exemption or reduction,”\n\nWhat does the phrase “…without any excemption or reduction…” mean?\n\n-We are of the opinion that what the regulation seeks to apply a “reduction” of 50%, but this is incompatible with the 30% reduction on labour earnings generated in over two years, which is provided for under Article 18.2 of the Income Tax Act, even when such a circumstance arises.\n\nDoes this tax benefit apply to taxpayers under the “special expatriate regime”?\n\n-In our opinion it does, despite that fact that most exemptions and reductions do not apply to these taxpayers (except for exempt payments in kind). We believe that the regulation is not classifying this tax benefit as an exemption or reduction.\nAccordingly, the Non-residents Income Tax Act (IRNR) tax base is determined in accordance with the Income Tax Act, thus in our opinion only 50% of these labour earnings will be calculated for tax purposes.\n\n\n\nWhatever the case, this regulation will be developed, qualified and explained in the coming months with the definite approval of the Tax Regulation and Ministerial Orders and we will provide further updates when available.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n• José María Leis Mayán, Partner | josemaria.leis.mayan@vialto.com\n• Sergio Murillo Martinez, Senior Manager | sergio.murillo.martinez@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global\nnetwork.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nUnited States | Immigration | USCIS update for FY2025 H-1B cap season\n\nSummary \nThis morning, January 12, 2024, USCIS released an update aimed at increasing ease and efficiency of the upcoming FY2025 H-1B cap season. The update also aims to reduce errors and duplicate lottery entries.\n\nThe detail  \nUSCIS expects to launch online organizational accounts beginning in February 2024. These accounts will be for use in both cap-exempt and cap-subject H-1B filings, and will digitize the entire process from beginning to end. While the H 1B cap lottery registration has taken place electronically since 2020, the subsequent Form I-129 and Form I-907 still required paper filings. The organizational accounts will be accessible to multiple individuals, including internal team members and outside legal counsel.\n\nShortly after these organizational accounts are rolled out, USCIS plans to begin accepting online filing of Form I-129 and Form I-907 for premium processing requests. USCIS will still allow paper filing of the forms if preferred, but will update the filing addresses to lockbox facilities to encourage efficiency. Lottery registrations will remain online only.\n\nOn January 23 and 24, USCIS will host national engagements as an opportunity for education and questions on the new organizational accounts. The events should appear here: https://www.uscis.gov/outreach/upcoming-national-engagements once finalized.\n\nWhat this means  \nVialto Partners will continue to monitor for additional details and will provide updates as needed. As this is a new system, we can expect there may be technical issues that we will need to address as they arise. However, we remain hopeful this is a positive update that will ultimately lead to more efficient and accurate processing.\n\nContact us\nPlease reach out to Manish Daftari to discuss further.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit: www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nContact us on the following address:  me-immigration@vialto.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Belgium | Immigration |  Changes to the Brussels and Walloon immigration policies for employing foreign nationals",
        "date": "September 4, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nChanges to the Brussels and Walloon immigration policies for employing foreign nationals\n\nSummary\n\nFollowing immigration law changes announced for the Flanders region (see our alert here for more), the Brussels and Walloon regions have also announced upcoming changes in immigration policy and legislation. These were inspired by the obligation for implementation of the EU Blue Card, but actually extend to different aspects of their foreign worker policies. The changes mentioned we will discuss in this newsletter, are significant and will have an impact for businesses and highly qualified employees.\n\nContext\n\nIn our last immigration newsletter, we already indicated that the legal landscape governing employment for third-country nationals in Belgium has been under construction, due to the implementation of Directive 2021/1883, known as the revised EU Blue Card Directive, into Belgian legislation, as well as other Directives.   The occasion of the last newsletter was the publication of the Flemish Ministerial Decision of 8 March 2024, which entered into force on 1 May 2024.  In our last newsletter, we discussed how the Flemish region implemented the revised EU Blue Card Directive, but also how they used this opportunity to make other significant changes to their whole ‘access to the labour market by foreign employees’ policies.   At the moment of writing our last newsletter, we knew that the Brussels and the Walloon regional authorities were making the same exercise, but when the results of these exercises would become public was not known yet at that moment in time.\n\nCurrently, both new legal documents have been published and it is known when the new policies will enter into force. Hence we share this new newsletter with you discussing the significant new changes for your foreign personnel in the Brussels and the Walloon region.  The new decision of the Brussels regional Government of 16 May 2024 will enter into force on 1 October 204, while the Walloon Decision of 6 June 2024 will already enter into force on 1 September 2024.\n\nEffective Changes in the Brussels Capital region\n\nThe decision from the Brussels Regional Government of 16 May 2024 executing the ordinance of 1 February 2024 concerning economic migration, laid down a new legal basis for the access to the Brussels labour market for foreign employees, as well as a new legal basis for the performance of self-employed activities by foreign nationals.  This newsletter will currently only focus on the new policy for foreign employees in the Brussels region, however questions regarding the new process for self-employed foreign nationals in the Brussels region can always be directed to Vialto Partners as well.\n\nFurthermore, the new Brussels legislation will enter into force on 1 October 2024, which means that the work authorization applications submitted prior to 1 October 2024 will still be treated under the old legislative framework by the Brussels regional employment authorities.\n\nSimplified wage calculation: average gross monthly salary\n\nFor applications submitted as from 1 October 2024, the applicable salary thresholds per work authorization category will be determined based on a specific percentage of the average gross monthly salary in the Brussels region, which is currently set at EUR 4604.  This means that as from 1 October 2024, the following salary thresholds will have to be met in the following work authorization categories:\n\n\n\nRegarding the applicable salary thresholds per specific category, the new Brussels legislation refers to the employee’s gross monthly salary, which is defined as the base salary (without any other additional salary components, such as holiday pay and thirteenth month).  We are still in discussion with the Brussels employment authorities on how this new limited salary definition will be interpreted towards foreign employees with a Belgian employment agreement versus foreign employees with a foreign employment agreement, assigned to Belgium.   We hope to soon receive clear feedback on this item from the Brussels regional employment authorities, however the idea of the new legislation is that any additional salary components or other benefits can not be taken into account anymore when determining whether the applicable salary threshold is met.\n\nForeign employees whose applications were submitted before 1 October 2024 will have to continue to meet the annual salary threshold of EUR 5.0310 gross until 31 December 2024, in order for their single permit to remain valid.  As from 1 January 2025, the new gross monthly salary amounts will have to be respected for these single permit holders as well.\n\nFurthermore, the new Brussels legislation does not mention a yearly assessment requirement anymore for single permits who are valid for more than one year.  The goal of this yearly assessment was to check if the salary thresholds were met on a yearly basis, but this check will now happen automatically by the Brussels regional employment authorities, thus it is not required for the employer anymore to submit these assessments.  But it remains important for employers of foreign employees to make sure that the specific salary conditions are respected, in order for the single permits to remain valid.\n\nNo managerial category anymore\n\nThe managerial category from article 9,7° of the Royal Decree of 9 June 1999 does not exist anymore in the new Brussels governmental decision of 16 May 2024.  For the employees previously falling into this category, a solution can either be found in the highly skilled category (if these conditions are met) or in the new exemption ground for the higher management personnel (but also only if these specific conditions are met because there is a quite stringent definition).\n\nImplementation of EU Blue card directive\n\nThe new rules for the Blue Card holders in the Brussels region are somewhat similar to the rules implemented in the Flemish region by the Flemish Decision of 8 March 2024 for the Blue Card holders.  For Blue card holders it will also become easier to change employers in the Brussels region, and in specific sectors, work experience and professional competences can be used to prove that the educational requirement within the EU Blue card category has been met.\n\nUnfortunately, the Brussels decision of 16 May 2024, didn’t mention the mobility rights for the EU Blue Card holders.  This means that there is currently no legal framework for EU Blue card holders, issued in other EU countries, to use their short term mobility rights (eg. quicker access to the labour market or possibility to be exempted from the work authorization requirement) in the Brussels region.  Vialto Partners has flagged this towards the Brussels authorities, who indicated they would check how the mobility rights can still be implemented in the Brussels region.\n\nNew listing of work authorization exemptions\n\nArticle 18 of the Brussels decision of 16 May 2024 confirms which activities performed by foreign employees in the Brussels region are exempted from the work authorization requirement.   It makes a distinction between the activities that are exempted as long as the employee’s stay in Belgium remains limited to 90 days, and the activities that are exempted regardless of the employee’s stay in Belgium:\n\nEffective Changes in the Walloon region\n\nThe decision of the Walloon government from 6 June 2024 concerning the work authorization for foreign employees has been published in the Belgian Official Gazette on 12 August 2024, and replaces the old Walloon Governmental decision of 16 Mai 2019.  For applications submitted as from 1 September 2024, this new legislation will become applicable.\nPlease find hereby an overview of some of the most relevant changes for your international personnel in the Walloon region:\n\nGeneral rule for work authorizations in the Walloon region: labour market shortage\n\nArticle 2 of the Walloon decision of 6 June 2024 lists the general conditions that have to be met in order to obtain work authorization in the Walloon region.  The general rule was, and will still be, under the new legislation, that a foreign employee will be given work authorization in the Walloon region as long as the employer can prove that another employee can not be found among the Walloon workforce within a reasonable timeframe to fulfill the specific position that the foreign employee will take up.\n\nThe new Walloon decision did not change this general rule.  However, there is a list of some new situations that will automatically prove the fulfillment of the labour market shortage condition.  One of these situations is the fact that the specific position is mentioned on the official Walloon list confirming the bottleneck professions in the Walloon region.  Another situation that would automatically fulfill the labour market shortage condition would be if FOREM (eg. Walloon Office of Vocational Training and Employment) can confirm that they can’t find a suitable candidate for the job position of the foreign employee.  In case one of the listed situations is not applicable, the employer can still try to prove the labour market shortage by all means of evidence,  but it will be up to the discretion of the Walloon authorities whether or not the labour market shortage has been proven.\n\nFinally, the new Walloon decision confirms again that the labour market shortage condition is not applicable if a work authorization application is submitted within a specific category (eg. highly skilled, european blue card, etc).\n\nNew work authorization exemption grounds\n\nThe old article 15, which used to list the specific activities performed by foreign employees that are exempted from the work authorization requirement in the Walloon region, has been revised and changed into the new article 65, that makes a distinction into 4 types of work authorization exemption grounds:\n\nA new exemption ground is created in this second exemption category under article 65, §2(1)  which provides an exemption for persons who “carry out temporary commercial activities related to the employer’s business interests, where no services or goods are supplied“: for example attending conferences, seminars, internal and external business meetings, participating in the negotiation of business contracts, participating in sales or marketing activities and giving or attending training courses. This exemption has a maximum duration of 90 days in a 180-day period. For this category of travelers, a Limosa declaration should still be obtained before starting these activities in Belgium.\n\nHighly qualified junior staff\n\nBoth within the highly qualified category, as within the European Blue card category, the new Walloon decision of 6 June 2024 also introduced a lower salary threshold for employees who have not reached the age of 30 years old at the moment of submission of the work authorization application.  For these foreign employees, the applicable salary thresholds will be lowered to 80% of the normal salary threshold.\n\nImplementation of the EU Blue Card Directive\n\nThe more favorable changes for EU Blue card holders in the new Flemish and Brussels legislation, can also be found in the new Walloon legislation (eg. easier to change employers, and work experience or professional competence as proof of educational requirements in specific sectors).  Furthermore, we were also happy to see that the EU mobility rights for EU Blue card holders, issued in other EU countries were also implemented accordingly in the Walloon region, as article 65,§1,°2 of the new Walloon decision exempts EU Blue card holders, issued in another EU country, from the work authorization requirement, as long as the activities of the Blue card holder in the Walloon region will be limited to 90 days within a 180 days time frame.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe legislative changes in the Brussels and Walloon regions regarding employment activities by foreign nationals are very extensive and diverse.  Employers in multiple different sectors, who are employing foreign nationals in the Walloon or the Brussels region, could be impacted by one of the many changes from the new legislative frameworks.  We have therefore chosen to highlight the most relevant changes in this newsletter, however we are always ready to also answer any questions on any specific immigration chance in both regions (perhaps not mentioned in this newsletter).\n\nTaking into account these upcoming changes in the Walloon and the Brussels region, as well as the previous changes in the Flemish region, it becomes also important for employers to reassess and restructure their immigration strategy, as other options may now be more appropriate for employing third-country nationals or as new conditions might become applicable in order for their international personnel to continue their activities in Belgium.\n\nFurthermore, we also have to conclude that there are still clear and obvious differences in the new policies amongst the different regions, despite the general European initiatives to harmonize immigration procedures for certain labour migrant categories among the EU member States.  Whether your foreign employees will perform working activities in the Brussels, Flemish or Walloon region, can have a significant impact on whether or not work authorization will be required and/or which conditions for the work authorization have to be adhered to.  In case your foreign employee might be exempted from the work authorization requirement in one region, you must not assume that the activities will remain exempted in another region as well.  As such, we strongly advise employers to first determine the competent region(s), based on the employees’ working locations, prior to starting the reassessment and restructuring of their immigration strategies.\n\nVialto Partners can always further assist your organizations with this reassessment exercise.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively\n\nBart Elias\nPartner\n\nAjshe Miftari\nDirector\n\nJoke Braam\nDirector\n\nSilke Van Bauwel\nManager\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "content": "11 October 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nSummary\n\nThe draft of the Italian decree implementing the revised EU Blue Card Directive has been published. The draft introduces new measures, including on accessibility to the labour market of member States for highly qualified workers under the Directive.\n\nThe detail\n\nIn order to address talent shortages across the EU, the EU Blue Card was introduced in May 2009 as the European equivalent of the US Green Card. The purpose was to make it easier for non EU/EEA nationals to work freely in multiple EU member states within the European Union. However, studies over several years have shown that use of the EU Blue Card category is generally low across member states. Therefore, a revision was proposed in 2016 and after long negotiations the revised EU Blue Card Directive entered into force on 17 November 2021. Member states have until 17 November 2023 to implement the amended Directive into national legislation.\n\nThe aim of the new Directive is to simplify the procedures and qualifying criteria, and to widen the scope and to strengthen the rights of EU Blue Card holders. Some of the most important changes are facilitated possibility for EU Blue Card holders to undertake business activities in other member states, recognition of professional experience in addition to or instead of educational qualifications and facilitated EU mobility after 12 months (reduced from 18 months).\n\nThe draft proposal for Italy contains the following main changes compared to the current EU Blue Card Directive, as implemented in Italy:\n\nThe Italian draft, through these significant innovations, embraced the purpose of the European directive in order to facilitate the access, the continuity and the mobility of high qualified workers and their families.\n\nFurthermore, the draft will be definitively validated and converted into law by the beginning of December 2023. Vialto Partners will continue to monitor this and the possible impact of any further changes or amendments.\n\nWhat this means for employers\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the final decree will contain the proposed measures. However, it is expected that the increased flexibility of the criteria and requirements under the revised Directive will also be reflected in the Italian decree implementing the measures into national law.\n\nContact us\n\nShould you require more information, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nGiovanni Maria Guidone\n\nItaly Immigration Lead\n\ngiovanni.maria.guidone@vialto.com\n\nA: Via Dante 16 – 20121 Milan, Italy\n\nM: +39 331 6710635\n\nW: www.vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com",

        "title": "Netherlands | Dutch Supreme Court ruling on the Dutch wage concept — impact on 75% employer’s levy calculation methodology (art. 32bb)",
        "date": "April 11, 2025",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nSummary\n\nOn 4 April 2025, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled in a case regarding the wage concept for Dutch wage tax purposes. Specifically, the Supreme Court ruled on the question whether tax exempt\nreimbursements and benefits in kind should be considered as ‘wage’ for the purpose of the so-called employer’s levy for excessive termination payments (hereafter: excessive employer’s\nlevy). In this update, you will find a summary of the Supreme Court ruling, as well as the impact thereof on employers.\n\nThe detail\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling of 4 April provides insight into the question whether tax exempt reimbursements and benefits in kind (as meant in art. 31a(2)Dutch Wage Tax Act 1964) should be considered ‘wage’ for the purpose of art. 32bb (the article on the excessive employer’s levy). In an earlier stage, at the district court and the court of appeal, it was ruled that based on the historical and legal systematic interpretation of the ‘wage’ concept, tax exempt components should not be considered as ‘wage’ for the purpose of the excessive employer’s levy under art. 32bb.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court has taken a different approach. In short, the Supreme Court ruled that the concept ‘wage’ for Dutch tax purposes should be interpreted grammatically, i.e. in line with Chapter II of the Dutch Wage Tax Act 1964, and hence that there is only one concept of wage for Dutch tax purposes. This means that for the purpose of the excessive employer’s levy of art. 32bb, in short, all wage components should be taken into consideration, i.e. including the tax exempt reimbursements and benefits in kind. This can for instance include the tax-free reimbursement for extraterritorial costs under the Dutch expat tax regime (the 30% ruling), or components included in the tax free budget (“vrije ruimte”) of the Dutch Work Related Cost Scheme (“werkkostenregeling”).\n\nWhile the Supreme Court ruling of 4 April provides clarity on which income components should be included, this further decreases the flexibility of employers under this legislation while increasing the administrative burden.\n\nBackground of the ‘excessive employer’s levy’\n\nUnder art. 32bb of the Dutch Wage Tax Act 1964, under circumstances an employer owes a 75% Dutch employer’s levy when an employment agreement is terminated and the employee is deemed to receive an ‘excessive severance pay’. The rationale behind this legislation is that the Dutch government wanted to discourage employers to provide severance payments exceeding one time the annual remuneration. However, due to the broad scope of the legislation, a 75% levy could also be due by employers in cases where no severance is paid to the employee. Similarly, the legislation could also apply in case an employee leaves the company at their own initiative, which makes the impact of this legislation difficult to predict from an employer’s perspective.\n\nCalculation methodology\n\nIn short, an employer owes a 75% Dutch employer’s levy when an employment agreement is terminated and the employee is (deemed) to receive an ‘excessive severance pay’. The legislation only applies to high earners (> EUR 680,000 wages on an annual basis, 2025 number). The taxable basis of this employer’s levy follows from a complex formula. The main element of this legislation (in short) is that it takes the employee’s remuneration in the year of severance (and following years) (“t”) and compares this with the remuneration in the second year prior to the year\nof severance (“t-2”) (recalculated to amounts on an annual basis). Insofar the total of the wages (including severance payments) in the year of severance (t) is more than twice the amount of the wages in the second year prior to the year of severance (t-2), the 75% employer’s levy is due (in short). We note that this simplified example assumes that the employment exists during the full year in the relevant calendar years (t and t-2).\n\nThe actual formula is more complex than described above and e.g. includes time-apportionment rules in case an employment does not exist during the full year. In addition, the calculation also takes into account the difference between the wages in the year prior to the year of severance (t-1) compared to the second year prior to the year of severance (t-2).\n\nImpact of the Supreme Court ruling of 4 April\n\nAs described above, the calculation methodology of art. 32bb Dutch Wage Tax 1964 is complex, with many variables that can impact the overall outcome. Aside from factors such as the termination date, it is important to include the correct remuneration components into the calculation.\n\nIn lower case law, there had been various proceedings regarding the question whether tax exempt reimbursements and benefits in kind (as meant in art. 31a(2) Dutch Wage Tax Act 1964) should be considered ‘wage’ for the purpose of article 32bb. Previously, in the majority of these lower proceedings, it was ruled that tax exempt components do not qualify as ‘wage’ for the purpose of article 32bb, and hence could be excluded when applying the provisions of this article.\n\nFor instance, this meant that individuals with a total income above the threshold of EUR 680,000 (2025) but whose remuneration was partially tax exempt (e.g. due to the application of the Dutch expat tax regime) with the result that their taxable remuneration was below the threshold, the position could be taken that the legislation did not apply (and hence no 75% levy would be applicable). Similarly, in- or excluding tax exempt components could impact the outcome of the calculation in other cases as well. Moreover, under this approach it was less complex for employers to calculate the impact, as the data included in the individual payroll of the employee was sufficient (and not, for example, the components included in the Work Related Cost Scheme).\n\nDue to the ruling of the Dutch Supreme Court of 4 April, there is more clarity on what income components should be considered relevant for the calculation of the excessive employer’s levy. Due to the fact that all wage components, i.e. including the tax exempt reimbursements and benefits in kind, are considered relevant, this will mean that more employees will fall within the scope of the legislation. This means that employers will have to further increase the monitoring of the potential impact of this legislation, to mitigate the risk of unforeseen, costly terminations.\n\nAction for employers\n\nIt is good to note that due to the ruling of the Supreme Court, the Dutch tax authorities could, under circumstances, issue a corrective assessment (“naheffingsaanslag”) in case of a previously filed return in which an excessive employer’s levy was declared (if the tax exempt components were previously not taken into account). Similarly, the Dutch tax authorities could potentially impose an assessment in cases where no return to declare this levy was filed previously. It is recommendable for employers to validate the potential financial impact in this respect.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWhile the Supreme Court ruling of 4 April provides clarity on what income components should be included, i.e. including the tax exempt reimbursements and benefits in kind, this decreases the flexibility of employers under this legislation even further while increasing the administrative burden. Even more than before, it is therefore crucial to review the potential impact of this legislation as early as possible in the (termination) process, especially for senior employees and high earners.\n\nAs Vialto Partners, we can assist you with the required steps to obtain insight into the impact, risks and opportunities to mitigate, how to communicate this with internal stakeholders and to take action.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nNiek Schipper\nPartner\n\nRichard van Steenwijk\nDirector\n\nDaan Hajer\nManager\n\nJoey Bontrup\nManager\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

The SDI program is funded through payroll deductions, the SDI rate for 2024 is increasing to 1.1%, and effective January 1, 2024, the SDI taxable wage limit is being eliminated. As such, California based workers will be subject to SDI on all wages without a taxable wage limit.\n\nIllinois – Paid Leave for Workers Act (Act):\nThe Paid Leave for Workers Act, SB208, was signed into law in March 2023 by Governor JB Pritzker which mandates paid time off to be used for any reason for Illinois workers. Starting March 31, 2024, or 90 days following commencement of employment, employees working for an employer in Illinois can begin using their earned time off for any reason without the requirement of providing documentation to their employer under the Act. Employees will accrue paid leave at the rate of one hour for every 40 hours worked up to a minimum of 40 hours in the 12-month period. The Act is a state-run program which excludes employees and employers that are subject to local existing paid sick leave ordinances (e.g., The City of Chicago and Cook County).\n\nMaryland – Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) program\nMaryland’s FAMLI program was established through the Time to Care Act passed. Any worker in the State who has worked 680 hours in the past 12 months would be considered covered. Employers will be required to enroll in the state plan or seek approval for a private plan that provides benefits equal to or greater than the state plan. Employer and employee contributions are required beginning October 1, 2024. The state plan contribution rate was set on October 1, 2023, which is 0.9% of covered wages up to the Social Security wage cap. The rate will be equally divided between employers and employers with 15 or more workers. Employers with 14 or fewer employees are not required to contribute but will still collect payments from their workers. Employees can begin receiving leave insurance benefits on January 1, 2026.\n\nVermont – Child Care Contribution:\nVermont’s Child Care Contribution (CCC) newly enacted payroll tax is effective July 1, 2024. The new law makes major investments in Vermont’s child care system, implementing changes in both early childhood and school age settings. The rate is 0.44% on wage income and 0.11% on self- employment income. Employers are responsible to pay a 0.44% payroll tax on all wages earned in Vermont. Employers have the option to deduct and withhold 25% of the required contribution (i.e., 0.11%) from employee wages. Payment of the Vermont CCC should be made in the same way employer’s remit their Vermont income tax withholding.\n\nOther State paid family leave updates:\n➢ Delaware: Employer and employee contributions are required for Delaware’s Family and Medical Leave Insurance program beginning January 1, 2025. Employees can begin receiving leave insurance benefits in 2026.\n➢ Maine: Employer and employee contributions are required for Maine’s Family and Medical Leave program beginning January 1, 2025. Employees can begin receiving leave insurance benefits on May 1, 2026.\n➢ Minnesota: Employer and employee contributions are required for Minnesota’s Family and Medical Leave program beginning January 1, 2026. The program premium rate will be 0.7% of an employee’s taxable wages. Employers may charge a maximum of half this premium (or 0.35%) to their employees through a wage deduction. Employees can begin receiving leave insurance benefits on January 1, 2026.\n\nHow we can help\nVialto can assist you in complying with your responsibilities related to state paid leave programs, including determining which employees are covered under the program, assisting with any required registrations, calculating employee and employer contribution amounts, drafting employee communications, and assisting with wage reporting.\n\nPlease reach out directly to your Vialto contact or one of the individuals listed below to discuss next steps.\n\nContact us\nPlease reach out to us to discuss further.\n\nTina Schrob\n+1 (201) 787-0114\ncristina.g.schrob@vialto.com\n\nGreg Fetter\n+1 (908) 313-6439\ngregory.fetter@vialto.com\n\nLigeia Donis\n+1 (202) 809-4072\nligeia.m.donis@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com",

        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nThe US Department of State has confirmed changes to its policies on waiver of nonimmigrant visa interviews, including eligibility criteria. These changes are effective immediately and apply across US embassies and consulates worldwide.\n\nThe detail\n\nSince the January 20th inauguration of the Trump presidency, the US Department of State has been making piecemeal processing changes at the various consular posts around the world.  However, as of February 18th, the State Department has made a uniform policy change on the categories of applicants that may be eligible for a waiver of the nonimmigrant interview.  Specifically, the Department confirmed changes to who is eligible for a waiver of a nonimmigrant visa interview (also referred to as the “dropbox”). Critically, these changes now apply worldwide across US embassies and consulates and are effective immediately.\n\nA waiver of the nonimmigration visa interview is now available only to individuals whose prior visa stamps in the same category are either still valid or have expired within 12 months. Individuals must also apply for interview waiver in their country of nationality or residence and have no prior visa refusals. Consular officers may still require in-person interviews on a case-by-case basis or because of local conditions. For more information, please refer to the Department of State website.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe new presidential administration has quickly implemented changes at consular posts, including these limitations on the use of the interview waiver (“dropbox”) process. Limiting the use of interview waiver will require more visa applicants to apply for in-person interview appointments and thus increase appointment backlogs worldwide.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nManish Daftari\nPartner\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "date": "October 17, 2023",
        "content": "4 October 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact – Medium\n\nSummary\n\nRegulators have recently signified their increased focus on superannuation compliance with announcements as part of the Government’s federal budget delivered on 9 May 2023 and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) 2023-24 corporate plan on 27 July 2023.\n\nProfound digital changes in Australia’s superannuation system in recent years through the introduction of technologies such as SuperStream and Single Touch Payroll (STP) has laid the foundation for increased data matching. This digital transformation complemented by the implementation of policy and legislation has authorities focused on reducing the superannuation guarantee gap (an estimate of non compliance with superannuation obligations) through data led superannuation reviews.\n\nThe Detail\n\nThe Australian government’s proposed rollout of payday superannuation commencing July 1, 2026 (announced as part of the federal budget) coupled with an increased investment in the ATO’s data matching capabilities in the 2023-2024 fiscal year, underpins a resolute commitment to closing the superannuation guarantee gap and ensuring employer adherence. This strategic direction is reflected in the ATO’s corporate plan for the fiscal year 2024 which lays out eight key focus areas with “superannuation guarantee integrity” featured as one of the key focus areas.\n\nOne of the key objectives in ensuring superannuation guarantee integrity is to review employer non-compliance more proactively. It is also worth noting that one of the recommendations in last year’s Australian National Audit Office report into superannuation non compliance is “that the ATO should shift from a reactive to a proactive stance” that is, ATO initiated compliance activity.\n\nTo achieve this objective, the recently released corporate plan articulates the ATO’s intent to expand its use of data in enhancing compliance by; assisting employers to meet their obligations, monitoring that employees receive correct and timely superannuation entitlements and taking firm action with employers who fail to meet their obligations. The key deliverables articulated in the corporate plan include:\n\nThe ATO has acknowledged the pivotal role that a robust data matching solution plays in driving a “proactive approach”. In this regard, the Government has initiated measures to bolster the ATO’s capabilities through:\n\nThese efforts – both increased funding and the proposed payday superannuation initiative – demonstrate a push to empower the ATO with the means to effectively execute real time data driven compliance measures.\n\nWhat this means for employers\n\nIt is evident that superannuation compliance is a key focus for the ATO and for the government. The increased availability of data since the introduction of STP2 has allowed the ATO to identify non compliant employers and share data with other agencies, such as State Revenue Offices. It is important that employers consider their overall compliance with superannuation obligations, including considering :\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact or alternatively:\n\nMaria Ravese\nPartner\nmaria.a.ravese@vialto.com\n\nKristy Whitnell\nDirector\nkristy.whitnell@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com",

This means that for air and sea travel between Bulgaria and the other Schengen Area countries’ border checks will not be applied.\n\nThe detail\n\nSchengen C Visa issued by Bulgaria\nAs of 1 April 2024, Bulgaria will start issuing the Schengen C Visa, allowing a 90-day stay within any 180-day period in the Schengen countries.\n\nMoreover, Bulgarian ordinary C Visas issued before 1 April 2024, granting a 90-day stay within any 180-day period, will automatically be considered equivalent to Schengen C Visas as of 1 April 2024.\n\nEnhanced Travel Opportunities for Bulgarian Residence Permit Holders\nIndividuals holding residence permits issued by Bulgaria, will be able to travel visa-free within the Schengen Area for up to 3 months.\n\nIn practical terms this means that individuals with valid residence permits issued by Bulgaria can move freely within the Schengen area for a period of 3 months without the need of obtaining an additional visa. This change is expected to streamline travel processes for those holding Bulgarian residence permits.\n\nTravelling by Land, Air and Sea within the Schengen Area\nCommencing 31 March 2024, checks on individuals crossing the borders between Bulgaria and the Schengen countries by air and sea will be lifted.\n\nWhile land border checks between Bulgaria and other Schengen countries will remain for the time being, it doesn’t impede the rights of Schengen visa holders issued by Bulgaria to visit other Schengen countries. This right applies to all types of transportation – by air, sea, and land.\n\nIn essence, Bulgarian Schengen visas will be universally valid for travel to all Schengen countries, irrespective of the chosen mode of transportation.\n\nThird country nationals not holding an EU passport will count their time in Bulgaria as time spent in the Schengen Area.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners Bulgaria point of contact:\n\nMina Kapsazova\nDirector\n\nEkaterina Arnaudova\nManager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nContact us on the following address – me-immigration@vialto.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "September 13, 2023",
        "content": "25 August 2023\n\nRelocation to Uruguay of technicians & professionals related to the IT sector.\n\nSummary\n\nLaw 20.191 was published on August 23rd, 2023, creating a regime for encouraging the relocation of technicians and professionals related to the information technology (IT) sector to Uruguay.\n\nThis law comes to provide a solution to the request of several IT companies working in Uruguay, who claim to have more availability of jobs and not enough individuals specialized in this field. Indeed, unfortunately, it has been estimated that the number of individuals that will finalize tech studies in Uruguay in the next few years is less than the number of open positions and it is not enough with the current job market. As such, the legislation aims to provide a relocation alternative for tech and professional related to the IT sector who are currently living outside Uruguay but would be willing to relocate to our country.\n\nThe regime created by Law 20.191 will apply to labor contracts initiated until February 28th, 2025, inclusive.\n\nBelow we detail the main considerations of this regime.\n\nIn detail\n\nThe legislation creates a new regime for technicians and professionals of the IT sector who relocate to Uruguay to work as employees of companies with regular and permanent activity in our country, who will now have the option to pay non-resident’s income tax (hereby “IRNR”) at a flat rate of 12%. It should be noted that, if this regime was not created, the general personal income tax applicable would be the resident’s income tax (IRPF), which has progressive rates ranging up to 36%.\n\nIndividuals willing to take this option will also have the possibility of being excluded from the Social Security regime of Uruguay, being therefore exempt from paying employee and employer social security contributions.\n\nFor the purposes of being eligible for this new regime, the individual must meet all of the following conditions:\n– Can be either foreigner or national, but he/she must have been a non-tax resident of Uruguay during the last 5 years prior to the relocation to Uruguay.\n\n– The individual should perform the activities fully in Uruguayan soil. For these purposes, the individual must have an effective physical presence in our country of at least 2/3 (two thirds) of the days.\n\nIf the labor relationship is not in force during the whole calendar year, the physical presence will be calculated upon the period of validity of the labor contract within the relevant calendar year.\n\n– The individual needs to obtain all of his /her total income exclusively from this employment labor relationship for the activities performed in Uruguayan soil. The activities must be comprised in letter S) of article 52 of Title 4 (Corporate’s Income tax – “IRAE”). We must remind that these activities are the following: research and development in the areas of biotechnology and bioinformatics, and the production of software, provided that the resulting assets are protected by the regulations for the protection and registry of intellectual property rights.\n\nArticle 2 of the Law establishes that this option needs to be performed at the beginning of the first labor relationship, and must only be done once, and will be applicable for the relevant year and for 4 years more.\n\nIf after the option is exercised, the employee is terminated, the acquired right of the individual to use this regime will remain unchanged within the applicable timeframe, and as long as the individual continues to render exclusively these type of services under dependent employment relationship for companies that obtain these types of income in Uruguay, and provided there was no more than one year between the termination date and the beginning of the new labor relationship. If the employee voluntarily decides to resign anticipated to this special regime, this resignation will be irrevocable and will comprise both taxes.\n\nFinally, the Law designates as “substitute responsible” of the IRNR tax to the employing entities of the individuals that have performed this option.\n\nHow we can help\n\nThe Vialto Partners team is entirely at disposal to assist the clients with regards to the practical impacts of the changes.\n\n\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\n\n\n\n\n25 de agosto de 2023\n\nRadicación en Uruguay de técnicos y profesionales del sector TI.\n\nResumen\n\nSe aprueba la Ley 20.191 publicada el 23 de agosto de 2023 para el fomento del trabajo y la radicación en Uruguay detécnicos y profesionales del sector de las tecnologías de la información (TI).\n\nEsta ley surge ante la necesidad de que la gran mayoría de las empresas del sector de las TI tienen una demanda insatisfecha de personal especialista en el área.\n\nSegún la exposición de motivos de la ley aprobada, el crecimiento proyectado de puestos de trabajos del sector de TI supera el nivel estimado de egresos de los distintos institutos de enseñanza formal del país y actualmente ya existe una escasez de profesionales formados y con experiencia. El objetivo de la ley es atraer profesionales del exterior, tanto nacionales como extranjeros, para profesionalizar el sector TI local, mejorando la calidad del empleo.\n\nEl régimen regulado por esta ley, aplicará a los contratos laborales iniciados hasta el 28 de febrero de 2025 inclusive. A continuación señalamos las principales disposiciones de este régimen.\n\nEn detalle\n\nLa ley otorga la posibilidad de que los técnicos y profesionales del sector TI que se trasladen a Uruguay a trabajar como empleados de empresas con actividad regular y permanente en el país, podrán optar por tributar el impuesto a las rentas de los no residentes (en adelante “IRNR”) – a la tasa proporcional del 12%. Cabe recordar que, de no abilitarse esta opción, el tributo que sería generalmente aplicable es el Impuesto a las Rentas de las Personas Físicas (IRPF) – a tasas progresivas de hasta 36%.\n\nSe dispone que quienes hagan uso de la referida opción, podrán expresar por escrito su deseo de no beneficiarse del sistema de Seguridad Social uruguayo, quedando en consecuencia eximidos de la obligación de realizar los aportes personales y patronales correspondientes.\n\nPara poder hacer uso de los beneficios que otorga esta ley, el técnico o profesional deberá cumplir de manera simultánea las siguientes condiciones:\n– Ser extranjero o nacional y no haber verificado residencia fiscal en el país en los últimos 5 ejercicios fiscales previos al traslado a Uruguay.\n\n– Desarrollar la actividad a tiempo completo en el territorio nacional.

        "title": "Luxembourg | Employment Tax | Individual taxes and social security",
        "date": "February 15, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nLuxembourg | Individual taxes and social security\n\nThe objective of this update is to provide employers and employees an overview of the main individual tax and social security changes which took place recently and which will have an impact in 2024.\n\nAt a glance\n\nIn detail\nDeduction of mortgage interest in connection with the primary residence\nGrand-ducal decree dated 26 July 2023 modifies the deduction ceilings as from 1 January 2023. Changes are as follows:\n\nOn top of the increase to the ceilings, there is one additional important modification to be noted. Up until the 2022 tax year, the ceilings were applicable as from the moment the taxpayer moved effectively in the property. This means that prior to moving into the property, i.e. from the date of acquisition to the date of moving into the property no ceiling was applicable (to interest paid on the mortgage loan as well as financing costs1). However, as from 2023, the event triggering the application of the ceiling of deduction changes. The triggering event is now the moment the rental value of the property is fixed, which occurs as soon as the owner may freely use the property for his personal housing needs (primary or secondary) and which is assumed, unless it is rented out or part of a net invested assets, to be as from the act of acquisition or the date of completion in case of a construction and regardless of whether the property is occupied or not. There are 2 exceptions to this principle:\n\nThese two exceptions are now the only cases where it is possible to claim the deduction of the mortgage interest without limit. As from when the construction is finalised or the restoration work is completed, the maximum deductible amounts will be applicable even if the taxpayer does not move into the house right away.\n\nThe week of 29 January 2024 the Government announced their intention to introduce measures which would impact the deductibility of interest in connection with property loans etc. A specific Bulletin will be published by us once the proposals are introduced into law.\n\nCosts for the maintenance and education of children who do not form part of the taxpayer’s household\nCircular dated 26 July 2023 increases the maximum deduction of costs per child from EUR 4,020 (regime applicable from 2017 to the 2022 tax year) to EUR 4,422 as from tax year 2023. However, the terms and conditions for granting the deduction remain unchanged2.\n\nFramework agreement on social security for cross-border telework \nOn 5 June 2023, Luxembourg signed the new Framework Agreement for regular cross-border telework which entered into force on 1 July 2023, right after the expiry of the transition period put in place during the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nAccording to the Framework Agreement, “Cross-border telework” is an activity which can be pursued from any location and could be performed at the employer’s premises or place of business and:\n\nAccording to these new EU regulations, a cross-border worker may work from home/co-working space while remaining affiliated to the social security system of the country where the employer is located providing that the following conditions are cumulatively fulfilled:\n\nThe Framework Agreement has been signed by the three neighbouring countries (i.e. Belgium, France and Germany). Please find the full list of signatory countries as well as all the regulations following the below link.\n\nhttps://socialsecurity.belgium.be/en/internationally-active/cross-border-telework-eu-eea-and-switzerland\n\nSince 1 July 2023, any teleworking activity carried out by a non-Luxembourg resident employee must be declared to the CCSS (i.e. “Centre Commun de la sécurité sociale”) regardless of the percentage of telework carried out. The Framework Agreement provides a transitional period according to which employers have up to 30 June 2024 (included) to declare any regular telework performed by an employee since 1 July 2023 providing that he has been affiliated to the Luxembourg social security system during the entire period.\n\nFurther guidance is expected to issue over the coming weeks and months from the different social security authorities to provide more guidance on the application in practice of this optional regime (for example, what if an employee has business trips, can they benefit from the agreement)?\n\nNew ceiling for telework for German residents \nThe amendment dated 6 July 2023, to the DTT in force between Luxembourg and Germany has been ratified by both countries in December 2023, entered into force on 29 December 2023 and is applicable as from 1 January 2024. The main modification is the extension from 19 days to 34 days of the tolerance threshold allowing employees to work from their home country or third countries while being still taxed in the country where they usually exercise their activity. In practice, this means that German resident taxpayers working in Luxembourg will be able to spend up to 34 days of either telework in Germany and/or work in third countries while remaining taxed in Luxembourg.\n\nNew rules for meal vouchers\nTwo Grand-ducal decree dated 25 September 2023 provides that the face value of a meal voucher may increase to EUR 15 as from 1 January 2024. Increases are not automatic and are at the discretion of the employer. The taxable value of a meal vouchers remains unchanged (i.e. EUR 2.80). The new provisions also provide various supervisory measures with respect to the use of meal vouchers as from 1 January 2024:\n\nProvisions impacting the individual tax liability \nGrand-ducal decree dated 22 December 2023 introduces an increase of the tax brackets by 10.8% (equivalent of 4 indexations) applicable as from 1 January 2024. In most cases, the new tax scales should result in tax savings for individuals, but other amendments will also have an impact on the net-in-pocket.\nThe below modifications to tax credits have also been implemented:\n\nHere are few examples of the above changes (i.e. new tax scales and changes of the applicable tax credits) comparing the net in pocket income of 2023 and 2024 tax years:\n\nPlease stayed connected with us throughout 2024 as we will provide updates on all individual tax, immigration, social security changes that may impact employers and employees.\n\nHow we can help \nWe offer a full range of HR related services including personal and employment tax and social security related services.

        "title": "Middle East | Immigration | Navigating immigration considerations: Mergers, acquisitions, and other corporate changes",
        "date": "December 20, 2023",
        "content": "December 2023\n\nImmigration\nMiddle East | Navigating Immigration Considerations: Mergers, Acquisitions, and Other Corporate Changes\n\nImpact High\n\nSummary\nIn today’s interconnected world, corporate changes involving mergers and acquisitions, consolidations, spinoffs and other forms of restructuring (collectively, M&A) have become vital strategic tools for businesses seeking growth and expansion, or needing to right-size their operations. As companies engage in cross-border M&A activity, it is crucial to understand and navigate the complex landscape of global immigration considerations.\n\nAccording to data from Statista, North America and Europe remain the leading regions in terms of M&A activity.\n\nThe Middle East is also experiencing dynamic activity within the M&A space with a total of 318 merger and acquisition deals amounting to USD 43.8bn during H1 of 2023. Since the pandemic there has been increased activity and consolidation in sectors such as consulting, finance, technology, fintech, healthcare and energy. Indeed cross border deals have been a key tool for supporting the region’s economic growth. However, given the current geopolitical landscape and the nature of M&A work, this can be a complex area to navigate.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why the Middle East has become an increasingly attractive region for M&A activity. These include the region’s sustained economic growth making it attractive for foreign investors; location – the Middle East is strategically located between Asia, Europe and Africa making it a natural hub for global trade and commerce, particularly for companies looking to expand their presence in other regions. Strong infrastructure – with many Middle East countries investing heavily in their infrastructure there are ongoing opportunities in construction, transportation and logistics; Technology, Innovation and Energy – the region remains a key player in the energy market resulting in ongoing M&A activity within the sector as energy companies continue to diversify their portfolios. In addition, the region is focused on increasing investment in technology and innovation leading to ongoing activity in the region within these sectors. The region also benefits from a young and highly educated workforce, resulting in highly skilled workforces in the region.\n\nIn this article, the Vialto Middle East M&A team explores the key immigration and mobility considerations that employers should bear in mind during such transactions in the region.\n\nThe current global economic situation and M&A activity\nGlobally there has been a surge in M&A activity in recent years, particularly post pandemic with companies responding to economic challenges by reevaluating their structures and exploring new territories in order to access new markets and diversify their operations geographically, or consolidate and reorganise their businesses. This enables companies to tap into new talent pools to achieve a competitive advantage, and achieve economies of scale, or increase profits. By merging with or acquiring companies in other countries, organisations can quickly establish local operations and leverage established networks and expertise.\n\nM&A activity can have a wide reaching impact on global workforces and foreign nationals who are on sponsored work permits or who have taken steps to gain permanent residency. This can also result in additional costs for employers, including additional reporting and filing costs. Read on to learn more about key immigration considerations and the main immigration priorities and risks for companies when embarking on M&A activity.\n\nKey M&A immigration considerations for employers\nWhen engaging in M&A activity, employers must carefully consider immigration matters to ensure a smooth transition for their workforce. Here are some essential immigration considerations for companies embarking on M&A activity:\n\n1. Assessing workforce mobility: Employers should conduct a comprehensive analysis of the workforce of both the acquiring and target companies. Understanding the immigration status of employees and their ability to work in different jurisdictions is crucial. This assessment helps identify potential visa, work permit, residency, and compliance issues that may arise as a result of the M&A process.\n\n2. Managing employee transfers: During M&A transactions, companies often relocate employees across borders or to new locations in the same country. It is important to understand the immigration requirements of the destination country as well as timelines, and ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. Proactively addressing visa, work permit and residency applications, as well as avoiding potential work authorisation gaps, is essential to maintain business continuity.\n\n3. Harmonising immigration or global mobility policies: Merging companies often have different immigration policies and practices. Harmonising these policies and aligning them with the new organisational structure is vital. Companies should establish clear guidelines for managing work permits, visas, residency, and immigration compliance, ensuring consistency and clarity for employees throughout the transition. This may also entail assessing different immigration data management applications to identify the potential need to integrate different data sources.\n\n4. Addressing compliance and due diligence: Compliance with immigration laws and regulations is critical to avoid potential legal issues, reputational damage, and status violations by the employees’ and their family members. Conducting thorough due diligence of the target company’s immigration practices is crucial to identify any compliance gaps or potential liabilities. This allows employers to address any deficiencies and mitigate risks effectively.\n\n5. Retaining/acquiring key talent: As mentioned above, one of the primary reasons for M&A activity is talent acquisition and retention. Retaining key employees during and after the transition is essential for business continuity and long-term success. Employers should consider immigration-related incentives or benefits to retain critical personnel, such as sponsoring work permits, facilitating visa transfers, or providing relocation assistance.\n\n6. Complying with statutory labour protections: Some countries impose duties on a surviving or acquiring company to satisfy employment obligations and protect the rights of displaced employees. An assessment of local laws affecting displaced workers is essential before the transaction closes.\n\n7. Government Approvals: It is important to determine whether the M&A deal triggers any government approvals or notifications related to immigration matters, such as changes in ownership control that require the transfer of immigration related licences or registrations. In certain jurisdictions, e.g. the UAE and Qatar, where there has been a change to the entity name, an application to the authorities must be made to amend the employee’s residence permit. Additionally, in case the M&A deal triggers the establishment of a new entity and the closure of the current one, a sponsorship transfer of all the employees will be required.\n\n8. Employee Communication: Communication with employees about the deal and any potential changes to their immigration status or work arrangements is important. Providing clear and transparent information regarding the impact of the deal on the employee’s immigration processes, work permits, and any necessary steps they need to take should be paramount.\n\n9. Integration of Immigration Systems: There will need to be an integration of immigration systems, database, and processes to streamline and centralise immigration related functions in order to improve efficiency, and facilitate consistent management of immigration matters across the merged entities.\n\nRegional considerations – M&A activity in the Middle East\nWhilst there are general considerations that can be applied to workforce planning during M&A activity, the Middle East does come with specific opportunities, considerations and challenges. These include:\n\nRegulatory compliance\nImmigration rules and regulations often undergo frequent changes in different jurisdictions – and this has been particularly true post pandemic, with immigration rules playing catch up with new ways of working and travelling and with technological advancements never contemplated when the rules were originally enacted. M&A transactions that involve international operations must take into account potential regulatory changes that could impact the immigration status of employees. It is important to stay informed about legislative developments, government policies, and regulatory updates to ensure ongoing compliance and effective management of immigration-related risks.\n\nThere are numerous regulatory systems across the Middle East to navigate that can increase regional specific challenges. Each jurisdiction will have its own set of rules and procedures for corporate restructuring which requires considered and careful analysis.\n\nImmigration and labour inspections in the UAE and Saudi Arabia are common, and changes to the trade licence as example could result in an inspection by the authorities. In addition, any findings of illegal working where employees do not have the correct work authorisation, have consequences ranging from Immigration portal blocks (preventing employers from being able to apply to sponsor expatriates) to large financial penalties, as well as reputation damage. Companies acquiring organisations in the UAE Mainland for example, will also need to consider localisation policies i.e. Emiratisation, and how they quickly will be required to meet local hiring targets. Saudisation rules in Saudi Arabia are also stringent, careful attention is needed to ensure compliance with this and whether incoming employees from the acquired company do not affect Saudisation targets or quotas.\n\nCultural sensitivity and integrating global workforces\nUnderstanding different cultural nuances is critical for effective communications with different stakeholders, particularly in the context of cross border M&A deals, where teams move from one country to another e.g. changes in headquarters. This is also integral to effective integration post deal and harmonising of cultures and policies.\n\nManaging talent, particularly across different territories in the region requires consideration of territory specific protectionism policies, such as quotas and fair hiring practices. Understanding your population make up (both pre and post deal) is essential to effectively navigate territory specific requirements.\n\nPolitical instability\nThe region is currently facing geopolitical challenges given the ongoing war in Israel-Palestine. Crises such as war results in increased uncertainties for businesses: from the security and safety of global workforces to ongoing business continuity and compliance. Understanding the geopolitical risks and how best to navigate and protect against uncertainties is key for successful M&A activity in the region.\n\nVisa and work permit transfers:\nWhen merging or acquiring a company, or embarking on other corporate changes, the transfer of employees across borders is commonplace. As such, navigating the complexities of transferring visas, work permits and residency applications is crucial to maintain business continuity and compliance. Employers must understand the specific requirements and timelines for transferring or displacing noncitizen employees. This may involve reapplying for visas, work permits and residency applications or transferring existing ones to the acquiring company, which may take on the role of sponsoring organisation under a principle known as immigration successorship in interest.\n\nIn the UAE, the mechanism or framework to ‘transfer’ employees from one entity to another will depend on various factors including the type of transfer and validity of the employee’s permit for example. In addition, it will also depend on whether it is a transfer within the same Free Zone jurisdiction known as an Intra company Free Zone transfer or within Free Zones in the same Emirate known as an Inter Free Zone transfer. Transferring employees from Mainland to Free Zone for example, will involve a different process. Understanding the process associated with each jurisdiction in which both entities operate (the transferring entity and the new employer or sponsoring entity), is critical to be able to advise on process and timelines and ensure that employees have the correct Immigration documentation and work authorisation.\n\nHow we can help \nGlobal M&A activity continues to transform the business landscape. As companies engage in these transactions, understanding and proactively addressing the complex immigration considerations are crucial. Whenever M&A activity is envisioned, we recommend that an immigration and mobility consultation be arranged as soon as possible in order to discuss timelines, costs and compliance issues, protect against disruption and ensure business continuity and prosperity.\n\nVialto’s M&A team provides specific guidance and advice on assessing workforce mobility, managing employee transfers, harmonising immigration policies, ensuring compliance, and retaining key talent. Our global mobility and immigration lawyers and professionals work closely with companies to support employers with navigating the global immigration landscape effectively during M&A transactions, while enhancing employee retention and morale. Proactive planning and engagement with immigration experts contributes significantly to the success of these endeavours, enabling organisations to leverage the benefits of M&A while mitigating potential challenges.\n\nListen for more insights:\nListen to our ‘On the Move’ podcast episode 25: ‘Don’t let immigration issues derail your M&A deal’ where our global immigration team, led by Sharan Kundi (Partner, Global Immigration Practice Lead), discuss how immigration can impact a transaction, and provide practical advice on how you can address this important issue.\n\nAll our ‘On the Move’ podcast episodes can be accessed here:\nhttps://vialtopartners.com/podcasts\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnir Chatterji\nEMEA Immigration Partner\nanir.chatterji@vialto.com\n\nRekha Simpson\nDirector, UAE Immigration Lead\nrekha.simpson@vialto.com\n\nAli Ibrahim\nDirector, KSA & Bahrain Immigration Lead\nali.a.ibrahim@vialto.com\n\nRaj Mann\nDirector, Global Immigration Advisory Lead\nraj.x.mann@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nContact us on the following address – me-immigration@vialto.com",

        "content": "The bulletin summarises the key income tax, social security changes that affect individuals/ natural persons and are in force as of 1 January 2024. The relative laws are L. 5073/ 2023 and 5078/ 2023, both voted at the end of the year 2023.\n\nIncome Tax\n\nBack dated and from the income tax filing of the year 2023, Freelancers as well as sole Entrepreneurs, will be taxed on the higher amount between the actual reported gain from their business and a minimum amount of income calculated on a “deemed” basis. The latter (“deemed income”) will be based on a specific formula considering the exact kind of the performed activity, the number of the years it is performed, the average turnover of the same sector in the market, etc.\n\nNew Freelancers and Entrepreneurs, entering the business for up to 5 years can enjoy lower amounts of “deemed” income.\n\nMoreover, Freelancers and Entrepreneurs have the right to not accept the “deemed” income calculation and instead be subject to tax audit by the authorities.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the “deemed” income calculation of the Freelancers and Entrepreneurs, the lump sum annual amount of the so-called “Freelancers and Entrepreneurs Duty” is reduced between the range of 25% – 50% for the year 2023 (previous amount was Euro 650).\n\nSpouses can opt for a separate personal income tax filing, as opposed to the default option which is a joint filing. All a person needs to file separately from his/her spouse is to file no later than February 28 of the year of the filing, an online application to the tax authorities. Once the application is filed, the separate filing is in effect for all the subsequent years until it is revoked online by the person.\n\nAny contract that potentially includes any term for any kind of payment in advance (either partially or in full) in cash is considered “void” and the property will not be transferred. In addition, a fine equal to 10% of the price with a minimum amount of Euro 10.000 and a maximum of Euro 500.000 will apply in cases of cash settlements.\n\nIndividuals who have put three (3) or more properties into short-term rental schemes, will be considered as “entrepreneurs” having the obligations to maintain accounting books, issue invoices, contribute to the statutory Social Security system and be taxed accordingly.\n\nNew levy called “transient accommodation fee” is introduced and is calculated at the flat rate of 0,5% of the relative revenue.\n\nFor up to two (2) properties, a new time limit of 60 days for the duration of each separate lease agreement is introduced, so they can continue classifying as “short- term”.\n\nThe minimum monthly salary for employees up to which social contributions apply is increased as of January 1 st , 2024 to Euro 7.373,53 (the preceding salary cap was Euro 7.126,94).\n\nThe transaction duty applying on the gross sale proceeds of listed shares in any regulated market or in a multilateral trading mechanism operating in Greece, is reduced from 2‰ to 1‰, regardless of whether the relevant transactions are carried out within or outside the aforementioned trading places.\n\nContributions (made either by the employees or their employers) to Occupational Funds (in Greek “TEA”) as well as Group Insurance Pension Plans remain tax-free, however as of January 1 st 2024, the tax free amount is limited to 20% of the annual gross salaried income. With the preceding provisions of the legislation, there was no limit as regards the amount of the contributions compared to the gross income.\n\nGrandfathering provisions, as regards the accumulated amounts per person until December 31, 2023 in the context of Group Insurance Pension Plans and TEA , have been implemented.\n\nGoing forward, the amounts that will be distributed to the beneficials/employees from their participation to the Group Insurance Pension Plan and/or TEA, will be subject to tax according to the following scale (the scale considers the ageing of the contributions):\n\nWith the preceding provisions, amounts paid by the employer for the medical and hospital coverage of its employees in the context of a group insurance policy, were tax exempt up to the amount of Euro 1.500 per employee/per year. With the new provisions, the limit of Euro 1.500 includes also amounts paid for the same reason to TEA voluntary insurance, not only by the employers but also by the employees.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAna Berta Lopez\nPartner\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit: www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Summary\n\nPursuant to the Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, companies based in Mainland UAE with more than 50 employees will need to increase their current\nEmiratisation rates by 2% every year. The UAE Cabinet has now announced a new resolution to modify the mechanism for achieving Emiratisation targets.\n\nThe Detail\n\nThe annual target for private companies to meet their Emiratisation rates, divided throughout the year by 1% in the first six months. Contributions, by\ncompanies that fail to meet those rates, will need to be paid bi-annually and not by the end of the year as was previously the case.\n\nPrivate companies are now required to increase the number of Emiratis in skilled job levels by 1% every six months, while remaining on track to achieve the overall 2% percent target by the end of the year – for Mainland organisations this will mean that by the end of 2023, they will need to have met an overall Emiratisation rate of 4% since the implementation of the new rates from 2022.\n\nThe Emiratisation contribution amounts for companies violating the Emiratisation scheme will be calculated and imposed from July 1, 2023, and the\ncontribution amounts for companies in noncompliance with the scheme from 2022 will continue to be collected. The MOHRE has clarified that the amendment does not include any additional requirements or penalties for companies. The change comes into effect on the backdrop of the authorities\nmonitoring companies that have achieved the Emiratisation targets by mid-year.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe fines and the Emiratisation targets will continue to remain the same. The overall mechanism for achieving the targeted Emiratisation rates has not changed. The authorities have stated that the most recent resolution aims to accelerate achieving Emiratisation targets and employing UAE nationals in the private sector throughout the year, and contributions will need to be made by any company in the private sector that cannot meet the required local hiring rates.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe understand that for many companies this will require careful workforce planning.

        "date": "May 21, 2024",
        "content": "Tax and Immigration\n\nAustralia | 2024-25 Federal Budget insights\n\nSummary\n\nThe Albanese Government handed down its Federal Budget on Tuesday 14 May 2024 focusing on tackling inflation and addressing cost of living pressures. Similar to last year, many of the measures affecting the workforce had already been announced, resulting in minimal surprises in the Budget.\n\nFor workforce tax and payroll, the big ticket item from the Budget is the reduction to personal income tax rates. Every taxpayer will receive a tax cut, including mobile employees – regardless of tax residency. These rates were entered into law in early March 2024, so no new announcements here. Payroll teams are breathing a sigh of relief that this Budget has left things relatively untouched as they head into their busiest time of the year.\n\nIn back to back years, immigration has featured prominently with a number of measures announced in the Budget to support the Migration reform strategy, including the introduction of a new National Innovation visa and the abolition of the Business Innovation and Investment Program. Whilst net overseas migration will significantly reduce, impacting international students, the Government’s commitment to skilled migration is clear.\n\nThe Government also continues its focus on compliance and monitoring measures across both tax and migration.\n\nThe detail\n\nWorkforce Tax and Payroll\n\nReduction in tax rates\nPreviously announced and legislated individual income tax cuts come into effect from 1 July 2024:\n\nSuperannuation Guarantee\nThe budget didn’t include any surprise Superannuation Guarantee announcements, nor additional details regarding proposed plans for Pay Day Super.\n\nAs a reminder, from 1 July 2024 the Superannuation Guarantee contribution rate increases by 0.5% to 11.5%, with the Maximum Contribution Base increasing to $65,070 per quarter. This means for FY25, the maximum mandatory employer superannuation contribution across the year is now $29,932.20.\n\nWhile the concessional contribution cap is increasing to from $27,500 to $30,000 from 1 July 2024, any taxpayers who have earnings at, or near the maximum contribution base, and who are considering additional superannuation contributions (e.g. salary sacrifice) should carefully consider the implications before proceeding.\n\nTax updates that may be of interest to your employees:\n\nImmigration\n\nMigration reform strategy\n\nPermanent Migration Program\nThe 2024–25 Permanent Migration Program planning level is set at 185,000 places, with 132,200 places (around 70%) allocated to skilled visa categories. From 2025–26, the Government will extend the planning horizon for the permanent Migration Program from one year to four years to enable better cross-government planning in the future.\n\nThe Government is aiming to halve Net Overseas Migration (net population impact through migration) from 528,000 in 2022-2023 to 260,000 in 2024-2025.\n\nAustralia-India Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreement\nFrom 1 November 2024, the MATES (Mobility Arrangement for Talented Early-professionals Scheme) program will provide a mobility pathway for 3,000 Indian national graduates and early career professionals (aged 18-30 at the time of application) to come to Australia for up to two years.\n\nSubclass 600 (Business Visitor) stream visa validity will be lengthened for Indian nationals from up to 3 years to up to 5 years.\n\nNew Migration Review body\nFrom 2023-2024, the Government has committed to provide $1 billion over 5 years to establish and support the new Administrative Review Tribunal (ART), replacing the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and to address court backlogs associated with high numbers of applications for judicial review of migration decisions.\n\nInternational students\nRegulations to be developed and implemented by the Department of Education to require universities to establish new supplies of purpose-built student accommodation to support any increase in international student enrolments over an initial international student allocation, to be set in consultation with the sector. The accommodation would be available to both domestic and international students. This could impact the pool of international student graduates entering the Australian workforce.\n\nGovernment compliance and monitoring programs\n\nAustralian Taxation Office programs\nFunding of $187 million will be provided to the ATO’s Counter Fraud program to detect, prevent and mitigate fraud against Australia’s tax and superannuation systems.\n\nThe Government has continued their commitment to the Tax Avoidance task force and Personal Income tax compliance programs, with a targeted focus on inappropriate deductions for rental properties.\n\nDepartment of Home Affairs programs\n\nFunding of $100 million will be provided to the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) to support performance of core functions, including immigration compliance. This supports the new Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Act which will commence on 1 July 2024.\n\nThis is in addition to a data-matching pilot between DHA and the ATO of income and employment data to reduce exploitation of migrant workers and abuse of our labour market and migration system.\n\nThis shows the Government’s continued commitment to reform Australia’s migration system to drive economic prosperity and restore its integrity, including expanded use of data-matching.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nShane Smailes\nPartner, Tax\n\nEmma Wappet\nPartner, Payroll\n\nStacey Tsui\nPartner, Immigration\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "South Africa | Immigration | Points-Based Work Visa System",
        "date": "October 14, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSouth Africa | Points-Based Work Visa System\n\nSummary\n\nThe Minister of the Department of Home Affairs (“DHA”) has implemented a Points-Based System which will apply to the existing General Work Visa and Critical Skills Work Visa categories.\n\nThis is a positive development to introduce objectivity and certainty into the adjudication process as opposed to the current highly subjective and inconsistent adjudication processes frustrating employers and applicants alike.\n\nThe Minister has publicly commented that this process will introduce a transparent framework to adjudicate visas in order to tackle corruption.\n\nThe detail\n\nPoints Methodology\n\nThe Points-based approach is based on the enclosed scorecard whereby applicants must achieve a minimum of 100 points through a combination of eligibility criteria.\n\nThe points-based system addresses the immediate business need to attract highly-skilled foreign nationals to the country with a consequent high focus on academic qualifications, work experience and earnings.\n\nGeneral Work Visa\n\nThere are differing routes to the 100 point threshold, however eligibility is mainly restricted to highly academically qualified applicants (NQF 9 + 10), with minimum 5 years work experience, who meet either of the respective salary thresholds or qualified applicants (NQF 7 + 8), who possess extensive professional experience, 10+ years, at the higher end of the salary threshold.\n\nAccordingly, applicants with less than NQF 7 academic qualifications, irrespective of salary, will find it challenging to meet the 100 point threshold unless receiving an employment offer from an Employer who is a member of the Trusted Employer Scheme.\n\nThe removal of the Department of Labour (“DoL’) Certificate, for the General work visa category, is the most welcome change. This removes the highly cumbersome DoL or Waiver processes which are both highly administrative, opaque and subject to ongoing excessive adjudication delays.\n\nThere is uncertainty around the following elements of the points-based system which will hopefully be clarified by the DHA in due course:\n\nSAQA: While the SAQA Certificate can be partially waived through the Points-based system (visa limited to 12 months and extendable upon SAQA issuance for the balance of the maximum visa period), it is unknown how the adjudicators will assess the NQF-related points allocation (SAQA-dependent) in the absence thereof. Accordingly, utilising the SAQA waiver option may result in the adjudicator disregarding such points, thereby limiting the path to 100.\n\nLanguage Proficiency: While this requirement mirrors Global standards, there is uncertainty as to how this will be adjudicated. The assumed process would be a verbal language assessment, as all work visa applications need to be submitted in person in the majority of countries (including VFS in South Africa), however this needs to be clarified.\n\nCritical Skills Work Visa:\n\nShould an applicant meet the eligibility criteria for an occupation as contained in the Gazetted Critical Skills List, such applicant automatically earns 100 qualifying points and may be issued a Critical Skills Visa provided all other prescribed requirements are met.\n\nIn this instance, the SAQA Waiver is a welcome introduction as it will enable the applicant to receive a 12-month work visa, subject to meeting the other prescribed work visa requirements, as opposed to having to wait the current excessive lead times for a SAQA evaluation.\n\nScorecard:\n\nPlease refer to the eligibility criteria and weightings below:\n\nCriteria\n\nDescription\n\nWeight\n\nOccupation:\n\nOccupation on critical skills list\n\n100\n\nQualifications:\n\nNQF levels 9 -10\n\n50\n\nNQF levels 7-8\n\n20\n\nOffer of employment: (Mandatory)\n\nAbove R968,184 per annum\n\n50\n\nAbove R645,456 per annum\n\n20\n\nWork experience:\n\n10+ years\n\n30\n\n5-10 years\n\n20\n\nEmployment status:\n\nOffer from trusted employer\n\n20\n\nLanguage skills\n\nProficient in at least one official language\n\n10\n\nWe will keep you informed as the above-mentioned open items are clarified by the DHA.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nStephen Marlin\nPartner: Territory Leader\n\nSupriya Boodhena\nSenior Manager\n\nNatalie McLean\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Germany  | Employment Tax | Recent developments in the application of assessment for person with limited tax liability",
        "date": "August 16, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nGermany | Recent developments in the application of assessment for person with limited tax liability.\n\nSummary\n\nAn application for a tax return filing for taxpayers with limited tax liability is also possible if the taxpayer is a national of a member state of the European Union or of another country to which the Agreement on the European Economic Area applies and is resident of or has the habitual abode in Switzerland.\n\nThe detail\n\nBackground\n\nAccording to Section 50 para. 2 sentence 2 number 4 lit. b in conjunction with sentence 7 of the German Income Tax Act (EStG), an application for a voluntary income tax return filing is only possible for individuals with limited tax liability if certain conditions are met. Specifically, this option is reserved for nationals of a member state of the European Union or of another country to which the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA) applies, provided they have their residence or habitual abode in one of these countries.\n\nDecision of the European Court of Justice (ECJ)\n\nIn a decision the ECJ ruled that this regulation violates the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons between the European Union and Switzerland. The case in question involved an EU national residing in Switzerland who earned employment income in Germany and was denied the right to request an income tax return filing. The court ruled that this regulation constitutes unlawful discrimination.\n\nRuling of the Federal Ministry of Finance dated 5 August 2024 IV B 8 – S 2301/22/10001 :001\n\nIn response to this court decision, the tax authorities of the German states, in mutual agreement, have decided to apply Section 50 para. 2 sentence 2 number 4 lit. b in conjunction with sentence 7 EStG as follows, pending a legislative amendment:\n\nA possibility for an income tax return filing must also be granted if the applicant is a national of a member state of the European Union or of another country to which the Agreement on the European Economic Area applies, and resides or has a habitual abode in Switzerland.\n\nThis decision represents a relief for taxpayers residing in Switzerland who earn employment income in an EU member state. The ability to request a tax assessment allows these taxpayers to claim work-related expenses and to offset income tax withheld at source, which could ultimately lead to a tax refund provided that for example no progression impact has an adverse effect.\n\nThis regulation applies to all open cases.\n\nGermany | Aktuelle Entwicklungen bei der Antragsveranlagung für beschränkt Steuerpflichtige\n\nZusammenfassung\n\nEine Antragsveranlagung beschränkt Steuerpflichtiger ist auch möglich, wenn der Steuerpflichtige Staatsangehöriger eines Mitgliedsstaates der Europäischen Union oder eines anderen Staates, auf den das Abkommen über den Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum Anwendung findet, ist und den Wohnsitz oder gewöhnlichen Aufenthalt in der Schweiz hat.\n\nIm Detail\n\nHintergrund\n\nGemäß § 50 Absatz 2 Satz 2 Nummer 4 Buchstabe b in Verbindung mit Satz 7 Einkommensteuergesetz (EStG) ist eine Veranlagung zur Einkommensteuer für beschränkt Steuerpflichtige auf Antrag nur möglich, wenn diese bestimmte Voraussetzungen erfüllen. Insbesondere ist dies nur Staatsangehörigen eines Mitgliedstaates der Europäischen Union oder eines anderen Staates, auf den das Abkommen über den Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum (EWR) Anwendung findet, gestattet, sofern sie ihren Wohnsitz oder gewöhnlichen Aufenthalt in einem dieser Staaten haben.\n\nEuGH-Urteil vom 30. Mai 2024 (C-627/22)\n\nIn einem Urteil hat der EuGH entschieden, dass diese Regelung gegen das Freizügigkeitsabkommen zwischen der Europäischen Union und der Schweiz verstößt. Konkret ging es um einen Fall, in dem einem Staatsangehörigen eines EU-Mitgliedstaates, der in der Schweiz lebte und in Deutschland Einkünfte aus nichtselbständiger Arbeit erzielte, das Recht auf Antragsveranlagung zur Einkommensteuer verweigert wurde. Das Gericht entschied, dass diese Regelung eine unzulässige Diskriminierung darstellt.\n\nBMF-Schreiben vom 5. August 2024 IV B 8 – S 2301/22/10001 :001\n\nAufgrund dieses Urteils haben die obersten Finanzbehörden der Länder im Einvernehmen entschieden, dass § 50 Absatz 2 Satz 2 Nummer 4 Buchstabe b in Verbindung mit Satz 7 EStG im Vorgriff auf eine gesetzliche Anpassung nun wie folgt angewendet wird:\n\nEinem Antrag auf Veranlagung zur Einkommensteuer ist auch dann stattzugeben, wenn der Antragsteller ein Staatsangehöriger eines Mitgliedstaates der Europäischen Union oder eines anderen Staates ist, auf den das Abkommen über den Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum Anwendung findet, und dieser in der Schweiz seinen Wohnsitz oder gewöhnlichen Aufenthalt hat.\n\nDiese Entscheidung stellt eine Erleichterung für Steuerpflichtige dar, die in der Schweiz leben und Einkünfte aus nichtselbständiger Arbeit in einem EU-Mitgliedstaat erzielen. Die Möglichkeit, eine Antragsveranlagung vorzunehmen, erlaubt es diesen Steuerpflichtigen nun, Werbungskosten geltend zu machen und eine Anrechnung von im Steuerabzugsverfahren einbehaltener Lohnsteuer zu erreichen, was letztlich zu einer möglichen Steuererstattung führen kann, soweit dem nicht beispielsweise ein Progressionseffekt entgegen läuft.\n\nDiese Regelung ist in allen offenen Fällen anzuwenden.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMathias Schmitt \nPartner\n\nDamaris Besenreuther\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&amp;R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "4 October 2023\n\nPersonal Income Tax\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nOn 15 September 2023, the Departmental Instruction Paw 161/B.E 2566 has recently been issued by the Revenue Department which is the interpretation of Section 41 paragraph 2 concerning Thai personal income tax implications for offshore source income.\n\n\n\nThis allowed Thai tax residents to plan ahead so that their offshore income was tax free in Thailand.\n\nRemark: A resident of Thailand, i.e., one who resides in Thailand for 180 days or more in the calendar year.\n\n\n\nThis instruction is effective for any offshore source income remitted into Thailand from January 1, 2024, onwards.\n\nNote: The new guidelines are in line with Thailand’s joining the Multilateral Convention on Mutual\n\nAdministrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MCAA) under the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) which is an international framework for exchanging financial information.\n\nClosing a Thai tax loophole on offshore income\n\n\n\nAny person who stays in Thailand for 180 days or more in each calendar year e.g.:\n– Inbound employees to Thailand\n– Outbound employees from Thailand\n– Remote workers in Thailand\n– Pensioners residing in Thailand\n\n• All types of income from abroad derived by Thai residents are covered e.g.:\n\n– All private income such as interest, rental income, dividends, capital gains, etc.\n– Non-Thai employment income\n– Equity compensation from a parent company\n\nWhat are the possible effects?\n\nRecommendations\n\nAs Thai tax rates are considerably high with the top rate at 35%, you should revisit all your earnings and/or future earning and plan how to eliminate the risk of double taxation (where the offshore income is from a non-treaty country) when claiming foreign tax credits is not possible. Where the offshore income is from treaty country, be prepared to claim a foreign tax credit against the Thai tax.\n\nChanges in tax interpretation could impact your net take-home. We will keep you posted since more guidelines from the TRD are expected.\n\nAs this interpretation is in its early stages, for more information or a discussion of your circumstances, please visit us at www.vialtopartners.com or contact us.\n\nContact Us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n• Jiraporn Chongkamanont,\nPartner\njiraporn.chongkamanont@vialto.com\n\n• Napaporn Saralaksana,\nAssociate Director\nnapaporn.saralaksana@vialto.com\n\n• Natchanond Charoenmechaikul,\nSenior Manager\nnatchanond.charoenmechaikul@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com",

        "content": "12 May 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact High\n\nSummary\n\nThe Brazilian government published the Provisional Measure (MP No. 1,171), which provides for the new progressive withholding tax table for monthly payroll deductions.\n\nThe Detail\n\nOn Sunday 30th April 2023, the Brazilian government published the Provisional Measure (MP No. 1,171), which provides for the expansion of the income tax exemption range for individuals (IRPF) and must be implemented as of May 1st on payroll deductions.\n\nIn addition to this, the Provisional Measure also predicted the possibility of using a simplified monthly discount, corresponding to BRL 528. If it is favourable to the taxpayer in relation to the deductions already allowed in the monthly tax calculation.\n\nIn addition to increasing the exemption range to R$2,112, the measure also implements a monthly discount of R$528 at source (as mentioned). Together, the two amounts reach R$ 2,640 for the exemption range, which corresponds to 2 minimum wages (BRL 1,320).\n\nTherefore, in practice, whoever earns up to this amount will not pay income tax either at source or in the Annual Tax Return.

        "date": "September 5, 2023",
        "content": "August 2023\n\nHighlight\n\nIn August, the China Ministry of Public Security announced that new policies will be implemented to enhance the convenience of business visa applications and residence permit applications in China.\n\nThe Details\n\nIn order to facilitate the entry of business travelers into China, an alternative option is available for those who are unable to apply for business visas in a timely manner at their departure country. These individuals can apply for port visas upon arrival at China airports. This allows them to enter the country and conduct their business activities while their visa application is being processed.\n\nOnce in China, these port visas can be converted into multiple-entry business visas at the local Public Security Bureaus. This provides flexibility for business travelers who may need to make multiple trips to China for business purposes.\n\nAdditionally, there is a new process in place for foreigners applying for residence permits in China. During the application process, foreigners can now keep their original passports with them. They only need to bring the passport back to the Public Security Bureau once their residence permit application is approved. At that point,the visa label will be placed in the passport.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe introduction of these two new policies in China reflects a positive trend in international trade and travel, as it provides greater flexibility for individuals traveling to and from mainland China. The ability to apply for port visas upon arrival at Chinese airports, in cases where business visas couldn’t be obtained in the departure country, allows for smoother entry into the country. These port visas can later be converted into multiple-entry business visas, further facilitating business travel.\n\nAdditionally, the new policy allowing foreigners to keep their original passports during residence permit applications and bringing them back to the Public Security Bureau for visa labeling once the application is approved streamlines the process and reduces the inconvenience for individuals.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the implementation of these policies may still be ongoing, and there could be specific requirements or procedures that need to be followed. To ensure a smooth and compliant experience, it is advisable to seek assistance from your dedicated Vialto contacts for any support required. They can provide guidance and support based on the latest updates regarding border control measures and immigration regulations, ensuring you remain informed and have access to the most up-to-date information.\n\nBy staying informed and seeking assistance when needed, you can navigate these new policies effectively and make the most of the opportunities they provide for international trade and travel to and from mainland China.\n\nContact us\n\nPlease reach out to your usual Vialto Partners contact should you have any questions on the above.

        "title": "Europe | Social Security | The future of teleworking in the EU",
        "date": "May 11, 2023",
        "content": "April 2023\n\nSummary\n\nAs of 1 July 2023, the social security relaxation measures for working from home are no longer applicable. There will be no extension, however last week the Administrative Commission discussed a new Framework Agreement for Telework. Such agreement entails that Member States agree to deviate from the general reference rules if a situation falls within the scope and limits of the agreement which allows for a more coordinated approach. Member States can choose to participate in this agreement or not. When participating in this Agreement, Member States will apply a threshold of 49% (instead of the initial ‘not exceeding 25%’ threshold when working in multiple states) for cross-border teleworkers.\n\nDuring the next few weeks it will become clear which Member States will apply the Framework Agreement. We will keep you posted on that.\n\nKey recommendations\n\nThe Detail\n\nBased on the EU Regulation for social security, employees living in one country, whilst being employed by an employer established in another Member State, will be covered by the social security scheme in their home country when they work 25% or more from their time in their home country. They are covered by the social security scheme of the country where their employer is vested if they perform less than 25% of their work in their home country. If the social security position of an employee shifts to the employee’s home country as a result of an increase in working from home, this will also mean a (unforeseen) shift in compliance and contribution obligations for the employer.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, employees have been able to work from home without any constraints, including without triggering a change in their social security position. This was based on relaxation measures throughout Europe. For some countries, these relaxation measures remained in place after the lockdown periods were over but are set to expire on 30 June 2023.\n\nRecently, a taskforce of the Administrative Commission (an expert group regarding Regulation (EG) 883/2004) has discussed solutions for teleworkers after 1 July 2023, as telework or remote work is here to stay. This has led to the suggested Framework Agreement from the Administrative Commission.\n\nThe content of Regulation (EG) 883/2004 will not change. Meaning that the European regulation still states that an employee is covered by the social security scheme of his or her home country if he or she is physically working in the home state for 25% or more. However, some Member States will accept the Framework Agreement to deviate from this main rule for teleworkers. The Member States who will accept the Framework Agreement will apply a simplified Article 16 procedure whereby, if the situation is in line with the conditions of the Framework Agreement, the authorities in the country of employer can issue an A1-statement unilaterally.\n\nBased on the Framework Agreement, a threshold of 49% (i.e. less than half of the working time) will apply for teleworkers working from home. The Agreement only applies to employees, not self-employed persons. It also only applies to telework in the residence country for one or more employers vested in one other Member State.\n\nFurthermore, it would only cover telework and not telework combined with non-telework in the home country.\n\nFor example, if an employee is working for a company in the Netherlands, but lives in another Member State, he or she can remain covered by the Dutch social security scheme as long as he or she works less than 50% from their home country. If the employee falls under the conditions of the Framework Agreement, you can apply for an A1 in the Member State of coverage (Netherlands).\n\nThis Framework Agreement, that will apply for teleworkers after 1 July 2023, is meant to make sure that the EU/EEA rules for the coordination of social security within the EU are more in line with the new reality of telework after the Covid 19 pandemic. For now, it looks like this simplified procedure can be applied for a maximum period of three years.\n\nHow we can help\n\nTo make sure you meet your compliance and contribution obligations, it is important that you apply the conditions of the new Agreement correctly. Vialto Partners can help you identify the employees that may fall under this Agreement.\n\nIn addition, currently, it is not clear yet which Member States will be part of the Framework Agreement. Therefore a country-by-country approach could be needed. Vialto Partners can help you understand exactly which changes will take place in the country-by-country constellations that your business operates in and implement these challenges in your policies and processes.\n\nWe are assisting large and small businesses across the EU/EEA in designing commuter policies and guidelines for Working-From-Home arrangements. We will be happy to leverage this experience to assist you in designing your policies, which are tailored to your company, business, and industry needs.\n\nContact us\n\nPlease feel free to reach out your local social security contact at Vialto Partners or to the Vialto Partners Social Security Leadership team:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Poland | Tax | The most important changes in Personal Income Tax and Social Security in 2023",
        "date": "January 31, 2023",
        "content": "January 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nSummary\n\nIn this update we discuss changes coming into force in 2023 including how the tax reduction is processed, not collecting advance payments during the year, changing the method of taxation of income from private rental, as well as the PIT- 2 form.\n\nTax Reduction Amount – taken into account by 3 payers\n\nTo date, employees have only been allowed to elect one employer as being authorised to deduct the amount reducing the tax from their PIT advances. From 2023, taxpayers may indicate in the PIT-2 form up to three payers who are to apply the amount reducing the tax. If we have one employer, 1/12 of the tax reduction amount (PLN 300) applies, if there are two – 1/24 of the tax reduction amount (PLN 150), and if there are three – 1/36 of the tax reduction amount (PLN 100).\n\nIn addition, contractors hired under a contract of mandate, a contract for specific work, or by persons on managerial contracts will now be eligible for having their tax advances reduced.\n\nResignation from the payer’s inclusion of tax deductible costs\n\nFrom 2023, employees can have their employer remove monthly flat-rate employee deductible costs. Such employee costs are deductible on a taxable person’s income from one public service relationship, employment relationship, cooperative employment relationship, or from outwork, in which case the costs amount to PLN 250 per month; if the taxable person’s place of permanent or temporary residence is located outside of the town where they work and the person does not receive a separation allowance, the monthly deductible costs amount to PLN 300. Previously, employees with more than one employer could have the costs deducted by each of them, however they are only allowed to have the costs deducted by one employer. As a result, many employees were required to pay tax surcharges when filing their annual tax returns. Now, deduction by more than one employer can be opted out of.\n\nNo tax advances during the year\n\nA taxable person may request in the new PIT-2 that advances on his or her income tax not be collected. If the requesting person does not exceed the PLN 30 000 ceiling during the year, the payer will not withhold tax advances on his or her income until the end of the year. However, if the income exceeds PLN 30 000, the payer will be obliged to withhold advance tax on the amount in excess of PLN 30 000 without applying the statutory tax-free amount.\n\nStatements and applications of taxpayers covered by the new PIT-2 form\n\nThe new template of the PIT-2 document for 2023 takes into account the changes mentioned above. It combines all statements and applications that may affect the amount of tax advances, and thus – the amount of net remuneration.\n\nIn order to get the most out of it, an employee should file a PIT-2 form at the beginning of the year, so that the employer as the taxpayer applies all the declarations and requests to all monthly salaries paid during the year, starting from the January pay. As a rule, PIT-2 is to be filed in paper form or in another format accepted by the employer as the payer, e.g. via payroll software.\n\nThe published PIT-2 form, valid in 2023, include a number of taxpayer’s statements and applications:\n⮚ Request for the statutory amount reducing the tax to be applied to monthly advances on income tax,\n⮚ Declaration on the intention to take advantage of preferential taxation (jointly with the spouse or as a single parent),\n⮚ Declaration on eligibility for increased employee tax deductible costs,\n⮚ Declaration on eligibility for specific tax reliefs, i.e. relief for families with 4+ kids, return relief for emigrants, relief for working pensioners,\n⮚ Request for the disapplication of a youth relief or employee deductible costs,\n⮚ Request for the disapplication of a 50% deduction on earner income,\n⮚ Request for the non-deduction of tax advances during the tax year.\n\nIt is important that taxpayers are obliged to withdraw or amend the previously submitted declaration or application if the circumstances affecting the calculation of the tax advance have changed. Withdrawal and change of a previously submitted statement or application is made by submitting a new statement or application under the PIT-2 form.\n\nPIT declaration submitted by children\n\nIf a person’s own or adopted minor children derive income from disability allowances, it will not be added to the income of their parents from 1 January 2023. This means that such income will be subject to child income tax and may require filing a tax return.\n\nRestrictions related to the relief on monuments\n\nFrom 2023, the relief for the purchase of historic buildings is curtailed. Expenditure on the purchase of a registered historic building or a share in one will no longer be deductible. Spending on the conservation or restoration of a historic building or construction works in one can be deducted only after such works have been completed. In addition, costs related to a historic building will not be deductible insofar as they go beyond the scope of works set out in the regional conservator’s permit or if they are completed contrary to such a permit.\n\nBenefits for public benefit organizations\n\nBy the end of 2022, the amount that can be donated to an NGOs chosen by the taxable person has been 1% of the tax shown in the PIT return. From 2023, it is 1.5%, which means that the option to donate a sum at the above rate will be available in the 2022 PIT return.\n\nIncrease in social security contributions\n\nIn 2023, the maximum amount of earnings on which the pension and disability insurance contributions are to be paid will increase to PLN 208 050 – based on 30 times the projected average salary (currently PLN 177 660). For someone who earns exactly PLN 208 050, the increase in pension and disability insurance contributions will amount to nearly PLN 3500 per year, while for employers this will be nearly PLN 5000 annually.\n\nThe increase in the minimum and average pay in 2023 will also translate into increased social security contributions for entrepreneurs. Those who start their own business will be able to take advantage of preferential social security contributions, the individual components of which will amount to 30 percent of the minimum wage. As a result of the increase in the minimum wage (first in January and then in July 2023), the increase in social security contributions for such people may amount to as much as PLN 600 annually. Those who do not benefit from the preferential treatment, will pay social security contributions amounting to 60 percent of the projected average salary. Given the increase in the average pay, such entrepreneurs will need to contribute even PLN 2500 more annually.\n\nPrivate rental only on a lump sum basis\n\nRevenue on private property rental will now only be taxable on the basis of a flat rate charged on reported revenues, with the step-tax option and deductible costs no longer available. However, you can still settle the loss on the lease from previous years.\n\nNo depreciation of residential premises\n\nFrom 2023, depreciation is not allowed irrespective of the type of residential premises or building. What is more, when renting their property as individuals, lessors will no longer be allowed to deduct the one-off tax on civil law transactions, notary fees, stamp fees, loan interest, and commissions that have been paid on the purchase or until the handover of the premises or building for use. Instead, the cost of the tax paid will increase the initial value of the purchased property and will be deductible only upon the sale of the property. The same will apply to housing renovation or retrofitting expenses.\n\n\n\nContact:\n\nWe encourage you to contact our experts if you have any questions about the new PIT-2 form as well as any other PIT issues.:\n• Mariusz Ignatowicz, Partner Director | mariusz.ignatowicz@vialto.com\n• Jadwiga Chorązka, Managing Director | jadwiga.chorazka@vialto.com\n• Joanna Narkiewicz-Tarłowska, Director | joanna.narkiewicz- tarlowska@vialto.com\n• Grzegorz Ogórek, Senior Manager | grzegorz.ogorek@vialto.com\nMore information about Vialto Partners can be found at this link: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nQatar | Update to the current local transfer of sponsorship process\n\nSummary\n\nThe Ministry of Labour has introduced a new simplified process for employees to transfer sponsorship between employers in Qatar.\n\nThe Detail\n\nAs part of the Ministry of Labour’s ongoing efforts to enhance and streamline processes in Qatar, the Ministry has recently revised its procedures for the local transfer of sponsorship for residents moving between employers.\n\nPreviously, the transfer of sponsorship process required an application form signed by both the employer and employee, and the submission procedure could be completed by the employee. The employee would log in to the Ministry of Labour portal and request a transfer of sponsorship by uploading the requisite documents, including the signed application form. Additionally, the employment contract information was drafted at the final stages of the transfer approval process.\n\nUnder the new process, the transfer of sponsorship application form is no longer required if submitted via the new employer’s login on the Ministry of Labour portal. The employer can simply submit their request for the transfer via the portal. Furthermore, the employee’s details, including employment contract information, are now provided during the initial request submission stage, rather than at the final stages of approval as previously required.\n\nUpon the employer submitting the request, the employee should then login to their National Authentication System “NAS” account via the Ministry system, review the salary details and approve the transfer conditions. NAS is used to authenticate the digital identity of individuals holding a residence permit, facilitating secure access to e-government services.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe new process is expected to accelerate and streamline the local transfer of sponsorship process, however employers could experience a delay during the initial implementation of this new process.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe anticipate further amendments and digitisation of services to be introduced by the government to existing services which are linked to the overall Immigration process, and it is imperative to stay up to date on these developments. Our team will continue to closely monitor and provide timely guidance on any new updates announced by the government.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnir Chatterji\nEMEA Immigration Partner\n\nRekha Simpson\nDirector, Middle East Immigration\n\nMarilyn Serrao\nSenior Associate, Middle East Immigration\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts Contact us on the following address – me-immigration@vialto.com",

The parties announced a 200-page government program placing significant emphasis on addressing illegal immigration and implementing stricter asylum policies, reducing asylum applications “to zero”. Furthermore, the program contains the intention to simplify skilled labour migration and posted worker notifications and to tighten, but nevertheless “modernize” citizenship rules.\n\nThe detail\n\nOn February 27, 2025, Austria’s centre-right People’s Party (ÖVP), centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) and the liberal NEOS reached a final agreement to form a three-party coalition government, to be sworn in on March 3, 2025. A central element of the new government program shall be to foster skilled worker migration and streamline citizenship rules; below are some of the key policy changes.\n\nControl authorities shall work more efficiently by controlling industries that are more risk-exposed. Effective sanctions are to be introduced to combat the thwarting of controls and underpayment. This shall be combined with improving the enforcement of penalties issued to companies abroad.\n\nThe government intends to tighten up citizenship rules while at the same time reducing bureaucracy, and is introducing the following measures:\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe newly formed Austrian government intends to introduce more simplified and streamlined policies when it comes to skilled worker migration or the path to Austrian citizenship.

The Special Act assumes that the provisions allowing the automatic extension of certain immigration documents and procedures will cease to apply as of 24 August 2023.\n\nDocuments and procedures which will no longer be in place are, inter alia:\n\nIt should be underlined that some of the legal stay is extended only if the residence permit application is filed in Poland after the document’s expiration date (e.g. Schengen visas issued by another Schengen State).\n\nWhat is more, the Covid Act and the regulations listed above may no longer be applicable even sooner.

        "title": "Canada | Canadian legislation banning the purchase of residential property by non-Canadians will impact global mobility programs",
        "date": "February 17, 2023",
        "content": "In January 2023, Canada passed legislation entitled the Prohibition on the Purchase of Residential property by Non-Canadians Act with the design to repeal after a two-year period. While this action is intended to help prevent rising housing prices due to non-Canadians buying homes as a speculative financial asset class1, it stands to have significant repercussions for global mobility programs. This article dives deeper into how the ban will influence talent strategy, housing program benefits, and other facets of international relocation.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nFollowing the pandemic, remote work demands on housing and labor disruption challenges saw the Canadian real estate market experience sharp declines in both home sales and rentals. While the 24-month ban on foreign nationals owning Canadian real estate appears to be a blunt piece of legislation, it is somewhat emblematic of a number of legislative measures (circa 2016 to 2022) that have been passed to address foreign nationals or corporations purchasing property across the nation.\n\nThe BC Additional Property Tax, Vancouver Empty Homes Tax, Toronto Vacant Home Tax, Underused Housing Tax and the Non-Resident Speculation Tax are examples of previous legislation which, in whole or in part, aimed to reduce acquisition / demand and improve affordability / supply of housing for Canadian residents. Though certain groups contend that this new ban unfairly targets foreign buyers and could possibly harm the economy, it is equally defended as a necessary measure to confront the challenge of housing affordability nationwide.\n\nWhile the fairness of this legislation remains outside of the scope of this article, Vialto’s recommendation is that organizations urgently take a current pulse of their mobile population segments and any associated costs when considering relocation / assignment budgets.\n\nWhat does this mean for foreign buyers?\n\nThe new rules will have a significant impact on global mobility programs. For one, foreign buyers will no longer be able to purchase residential property in Canada. This includes investment properties, vacation homes, and other types of residential real estate. Additionally, foreign buyers who already own property in Canada may experience a lower return on their capital investment, if during their ownership, they are subject to one or more of the federal and provincial charges targeting vacant or underused property.\n\nThese changes are likely to discourage foreign investment in Canadian real estate, which could have a ripple effect on the housing market and economy. For companies with global mobility programs, it may become more difficult to attract and retain international talent if the legislation leads to Canada no longer being seen as a desirable place for foreign nationals to live and work.\n\nHow will this affect global mobility programs?\n\nMany global mobility programs provide the benefit in which employees can purchase property in the host country as part of their relocation package. However, the Canadian government’s recent ban stands to have a significant and costly impact on these programs.\n\nEmployees who are relocating to Canada, and those who are already in Canada and do not meet the criteria for purchase, will no longer be eligible to use their company’s relocation package to purchase property. This could deter some employees from relocating, as they may not want to live in a leased or rental accommodation.\n\nThe ban could also affect global mobility programs that assist with purchasing property. These program managers will now need to assess alternative ways to help employees with their housing needs.\n\nTalent streams impacted by this ban\n\nUnder the current design, the legislation and the exceptions in place will have an adverse impact on three key categories of talent in Canada: temporary foreign workers, international students, and permanent hires.\n\nCanadian work permit (WP) holders will need to meet a three-year residency requirement (as of January 1, 2023) before they would be eligible to purchase real estate. In summary, the criteria is as follows:\n\nIn other words, a work permit holder who is on a three-year assignment that commenced in 2022, or will commence in 2023, would have to prove that Canadian income taxes were filed in any province for 2019 to 2021, which is unlikely. Consequently, the traditional transition from temporary housing to permanent housing is no longer a viable option.\n\nFor international students and post-graduation work permit holders, the criteria is as follows:\n\nFor context, the national average house price in December 2022 was C$626,000. In the country’s capital city, Ottawa, it was C$611,000. Calgary and Montreal reflected averages of C$506,000 and C$499,000 respectively. Greater Vancouver and Greater Toronto, meanwhile, had average prices exceeding C$1 million2. The annual median salary in Canada as recently as 2022 was $26,800 per year for post graduate students3.\n\nThe competitiveness of intern and recent graduate mobility programs will need to be benchmarked to determine their ability to attract and retain this segment of future talent in Canada.\n\nWhat can global mobility teams do now?\n\nThe impact of this legislation on global mobility programs is already starting to be seen. It will likely have far-reaching implications for employers seeking to attract key talent from abroad through long-term assignments, as well as permanent international new hires or transfers into Canada.\n\nTo quantify the impact on talent strategies and the financial implications on program benefits (e.g., extended housing, duplicate housing, home sale / purchase / marketing, broker market analysis, and guaranteed buy-outs, etc.) it’s essential that global mobility program teams perform a current state assessment and workforce forecast. Specifically, Vialto encourages teams to consider the following factors:\n\nIn its current form, the Act is set to be automatically repealed in 2025, but this timeline may change. How the ban will impact global mobility program costs, its effect on real estate and service provider service delivery models, and whether it can be implemented practically are also unknown. Program managers must stay updated on developments so that they can effectively manage duty of care during relocation periods, and enable workers to settle in Canada without compromising employee satisfaction and business continuity.\n\nContact us\n\nPlease reach out to your usual Vialto Partners contact should you have any questions on the new legislation and its impact on your global mobility program.

Das Bundeskabinett beschließt eine Formulierungshilfe für rentenpolitische Maßnahmen zur Stärkung der Wirtschaft.\n\nUm dem Fachkräftemangel entgegenzuwirken und die Erfahrung älterer Arbeitnehmer so lange wie möglich zu erhalten, hat das Kabinett folgende Maßnahmen beschlossen:\n\nPersonen, die das Regelalter erreicht haben, können leichter zu ihrem vorherigen Arbeitgeber zurückkehren. Sie dürfen einen befristeten Arbeitsvertrag ohne besonderen Grund abschließen.\n\nHinterbliebene, die eine Rente wegen Todes erhalten, können bis zu 538 € im Monat dazu verdienen, ohne dass dies auf ihre Rente angerechnet wird. So bleibt eine Vollzeitarbeit bis zum Mindestlohn anrechnungsfrei.\n\nArbeitgeber müssen keine Beiträge zur Arbeitsförderung und Rentenversicherung mehr zahlen, wenn sie diese Beträge stattdessen direkt an Arbeitnehmer im Rentenalter auszahlen. Das soll einen Anreiz schaffen, mehr zu arbeiten.\n\nDies bedeutet konkret bei einem Jahresgehalt von beispielsweise 54.000 €:\n54.000 € / 12 Monate = 4500 € pro Monat\n+ Arbeitgeberanteil Arbeitslosenversicherung: 1,3% = 58,50 €\n+Arbeitgeberanteil Rentenversicherung: 9,3% = 418,50 €\nDamit würde der Arbeitnehmer monatlich 477 € direkt vom Arbeitgeber erhalten.\n\nWer nach Erreichen der Regelaltersgrenze weiter arbeitet und seinen Renteneintritt aufschiebt, kann eine Einmalzahlung (Rentenaufschubprämie) erhalten. Dies anstelle der monatlichen Zuschläge und gilt, wenn die Person mindestens ein Jahr in einer versicherungspflichtigen Beschäftigung bleibt.\n\nZusammengefasst sind die Maßnahmen ein wichtiger Schritt, um die Wirtschaft zu stärken und bieten mehr Flexibilität für ältere Arbeitnehmer, dem Arbeitsmarkt so lange wie möglich erhalten zu bleiben.\n\nWorking at retirement age is to become less complicated. The Federal Cabinet adopts a formulation aid for pension policy measures to strengthen the economy.\n\nTo counteract the shortage of skilled labour and retain the experience of older employees for as long as possible, the cabinet has decided on the following measures:\n\nPeople who have reached the standard age can return to their previous employer more easily. They may conclude a fixed-term employment contract without a special reason.\n\nSurviving dependants who receive a pension due to death can earn up to 538 € per month without this being deducted from their pension. This means that full-time work up to the minimum wage is not taken into account.\n\nEmployers no longer have to pay contributions to labour promotion and pension insurance if they pay these amounts directly to employees of retirement age instead. This is intended to incentivise employees to work more.\n\nIn concrete terms, this means for an annual salary of 54,000 €, for example:\n54,000 € / 12 months = 4500 € per month.\n+ employer’s contribution to unemployment insurance: 1.3% = 58.50 €\n+ employer’s contribution to pension insurance: 9.3% = 418.50 €\nWith this, the employee would receive 477 € per month directly from the employer.\n\nAnyone who continues to work after reaching the standard retirement age and postpones retirement can receive a one-off payment (pension deferral bonus). This replaces the monthly supplements and applies if the person remains in employment subject to compulsory insurance for at least one year. In summary, the measures are an important step towards strengthening the economy and offer more flexibility for older workers to remain in the labour market for as long as possible.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the situation and provide any relevant updates.\n\nContact your Vialto Partners contact, or one of us in the information below if you have any queries about this update, or would like to discuss any other business immigration and mobility issues.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nUlrich Buschermöhle\nDirector – Global Social Security Services\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "content": "5 July 2023\n\nEmployment tax\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nThe purpose of the law which has been recently passed by the Luxembourg government is to create the legal basis for some of the measures decided in the third tripartite agreement of March 2023. The measures are expected to have a positive impact on the net income of all taxpayers as from 2023.\n\nThe Detail\n\nA new tax credit (CIC – credit d’impôt conjuncture) for self-employed individuals, employees and pensioners has been voted into law. The CIC has retroactive effect to 1 January 2023. The CIC will result in a refund of taxes for all taxpayers. As an example – a single employee who earns EUR 5,000 gross per month should expect to have a net increase of EUR 44 per month.\n\nAs from 1 January 2024 the CIC will be replaced by adjusting the personal income tax bands. The adjustment is the equivalent of two and a half indexations (i.e. 6.376%).\n\nA supplementary tax credit (CO2-CI) has been introduced for self-employed individuals, employees, and pensioners for the purpose of compensating for the impact of the carbon tax. It is proposed to introduce this tax credit from the 2024 taxation year.\n\nAn additional exemption will be effective from the 2023 tax year for net income realized through the rental of housing via organizations who provide social housing. The exemption will increase from the current 50 percent share to a 75 percent share from the 2023 taxation year.\n\nThe government have confirmed the extension of the subsidy for fuel oil and the subsidy for liquefied petroleum gas (household bulk propane) until 31 December 2024.\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that the impact of these changes will vary depending on each individual situation – family circumstances, income levels etc. Some examples provided by the government may be found by clicking on this link: https://gouvernement.lu\n\nWe can help you understand what these changes may mean for your business and your employees.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n• Eric Paques, Partner | eric.paques@vialto.com\n\n• Denise Chambers, Director | d.chambers@vialto.com\n\n• Renee Inchekel, Senior Manager | renee.inchekel@vialto.com\n\n• Tania Fernandes Morais, Senior Manager | tania.fernandes.morais@vialto.com\n\n• Michael Roser, Senior Manager | Michael.roser@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "March 28, 2025",
        "content": "Business Travel\n\nSummary\n\nThe implementation of the European Union’s Entry/Exit System (EES) has been further delayed, and is now expected to become operational in October 2025. The European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS) is expected to be implemented in the last quarter of 2026.\n\nThe detail\n\nThe Entry/Exit System\n\nThe Entry/Exit System (EES) is a new border management system that will digitally register the data of non-EU citizens every time they enter and exit external Schengen borders. It will replace the physical stamping of passports at passport control. The EES will impact short-term travelers to Europe, collecting information for both visa and visa-free nationals, whether they are travelling for business or tourism.\n\nOn 5 March, EU Home Affairs Ministers agreed on a regulation that will allow for the gradual implementation of the EES across 29 countries over a six-month period. This phased approach aims to give border authorities and the transport industry sufficient time to adjust to the new procedures.\n\nThe European Travel Information and Authorization System\n\nThe implementation of the European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS) is expected to follow in the last quarter of 2026. ETIAS is a digital pre-travel authorization for visa-free nationals travelling to the Schengen Area and Cyprus, similar to the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) used in the USA.

        "date": "November 3, 2023",
        "content": "30 October 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nNew amendments of the Law No. 227/2015 (Romanian Fiscal Code) are adopted through the Law No. 296/2023 that was published in the Official Gazette No. 677 on 27 October 2023. The income tax and social security amendments will come into force starting with November 2023, January 2024 and July 2024.\n\nThe Detail\n\nLimited income tax exemption and reduced rate of the mandatory pension contribution similarly applicable for software developers, for workers in the constructions sector, as well as food industry and agriculture\n\nLaw 296/2023 is limiting the income tax exemption on salary income and income assimilated to salaries up to and including RON 10,000 gross, derived by individuals who carry out software development activities, similar to the ones rendering constructions activities or work in agriculture or the food industry, until 31 December 2028. The exemption is applicable where the employee has the primary workplace.\n\nThe part of the gross monthly income exceeding RON 10,000 does not benefit from tax relief.\n\nAdditionally, for employees in the construction sector, food industry and agriculture, as well as for employees carrying out software development activities, the mandatory pension contribution will be decreased with the percentage of the contribution for the privately managed pension fund – 2nd Pillar (the decrease is 3.75% currently, however the decrease may be 4.75% as of 1 January 2024). Nonetheless, the employees may opt to maintain the current full pension deductions, by signing an agreement with the employer.\n\nThese provisions come into force from the 1st of November 2023.\n\nElimination of some social security facilities applicable to the employees working in the construction sector, the food industry and agriculture\n\nThe exemptions from the payment of the health insurance contribution, the social security contribution for special working conditions and the reduced work insurance contribution are eliminated for the employees deriving salary income in the construction sector, the food industry and agriculture starting from November 2023.\n\nLimitation of the social security facilities applicable to some salary benefits\n\nThe value of meal vouchers and holiday vouchers will be introduced into the calculation basis of the health insurance contribution, starting with January 2024. Thus, these benefits remain exempt only from the payment of the pension contribution.\n\nThe value of the tourist or/and treatment services, including transport, during the vacation period, for the employees and their family members, are not subject to income tax and social security contributions, within the annual limit provided by the law and the monthly ceiling of 33% of the base salary corresponding to the job occupied, only in case the employees do not benefit also from holiday vouchers.\n\nThe health insurance contribution due by the individuals deriving income from independent activities and other private income\n\nThe annual calculation basis for the health insurance contribution is equal to the net annual income/gross realised income or the annual income norm, but not exceeding the level of 60 national minimum gross salaries in force at the filing deadline of the annual income tax and social security declaration 212. Annual fiscal losses reported from previous years may not be considered when calculating the health insurance contribution due.\n\nThese provisions apply for self-employment income derived from the year 2024 onwards.\n\nAdditionally, if individuals derive income from intellectual property rights, rental income, investment income (capital gains, dividends, interest), from agricultural activities, forestry and fish farming, other sources which cumulatively exceed the thresholds of 6, 12 and 24 national minimum gross salaries, the health insurance contribution is also due.\n\nFor the purpose of establishing the thresholds of 6, 12 and 24 national minimum gross salaries to which the health contribution rate is applied, the paid income from interest and dividends (net income) will be considered and not the gross value of the interest and dividends, as it was provided before.\n\nIncome from unidentified sources\n\nStarting July 2024, any income for which the source cannot be identified by the tax authorities, will be subject to 70% income tax rate (in the previous regulation the rate was 16%) applied to the adjusted taxable base. The tax authorities will issue a tax decision with respect to the income tax and late payment charges due for this income.\n\nNew taxable base for income from independent activities realised based on contracts for sports activities\n\nThe health contribution due for income from independent activities realised based on contracts for sports activities will be deductible for the calculation of the income tax due starting January 2024.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nIrina Marinescu\nDirector \nirina.marinescu@vialto.com\n\nCristina Cristea\nSenior Manager \ncristina.c.cristea@vialto.com\n\nIoana Petric\nManager \nioana. petric@vialto.com\n\nRaluca Stancila\nManager\nraluca.stancila@vialto.com\n\nRaluca Ursu\nSenior Associate \nraluca.ursu@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com",

        "content": "Immigration\n\nPoland | Planned extension of the temporary protection in Poland | Further changes for Ukrainians—draft amendment to the Special Act in the second quarter of 2024\n\nSummary\n\nDraft amendment of the Act on assistance to citizens of Ukraine in connection with the armed conflict on the territory of this country (hereinafter: Special Act) was passed by the council of Ministers in Poland. The law must still be approved by the Parliament and signed by the President. The proposed act provides for favorable changes for Ukrainian citizens regarding their stay in Poland. Legal stay and benefits are planned to be extended until 30 September, 2025.\n\nThe detail\n\nThe Special Act which is in force as of 12 March 2022 provides for many solutions legalizing the work and stay of Ukrainian citizens on the territory of Poland. The current law allows the Ukrainian nationals to stay in Poland until 30 June 2024 (with some exceptions). The draft amendment proposes inter alia:\n\n⎯ Extension of legal stay of Ukrainian nationals until 30 September 2025.\n⎯ Extension of the right to remain in the country by Ukrainian citizens who arrived in Poland before the war started.\n⎯ Possibility to apply for a temporary residence permit for family reunification for family members of Ukrainian citizens with temporary protection (UKR) status. So far, only Ukrainians covered by the temporary protection in Poland performing work or running their own business activity could apply for a temporary residence permit.\n⎯ Shortened deadline for legalizing work in Poland of a Ukrainian employee – the employer should notify the Labor Office on employing a citizen of Ukraine within 7 days from the employment start date (as opposed to 14 days). The proposed provisions also specify specific instances where it is required to resubmit the notification to the Labor Office on employing a citizen of Ukraine.\n⎯ New obligations imposed on the Ukrainian employees – e.g., to inform the employer about obtaining a Single Permit within 7 days of its receipt to allow the employer to notify the Labor Office on employing a citizen of Ukraine within the statutory deadline.\n⎯ Additional simplifications for running a business in Poland by Ukrainian nationals.\n\nThe draft law also announces several other changes regarding temporary protection (the so-called obtaining a PESEL UKR). It is planned, among others:\n\n⎯ Introducing the obligation to obtain a PESEL number immediately after arriving in Poland (as opposed to 30 days after arrival to Poland).\n\n⎯ Obligation to confirm the identity by the Ukrainian citizen only with a valid travel document. A valid passport is also required to file for a residence permit in Poland.\n\n⎯ Changes in the rules for personal appearance and taking fingerprints of minors:\n\n⎯ Repeal of the ability to confirm identity through “mObywatel” application which may result in cancellation of diia.pl, application allowing traveling outside Poland.\n\nThe Ministry of Interior Affairs and Administration also announced:\n\n⎯ Introduction compulsory schooling for children of Ukrainian citizens from September 1, 2024 and linking access to social benefits to the fulfillment of this obligation.\n⎯ Introduction of a simplified/accelerated path for applying (via electronic system) for a residence permit for temporary protection (UKR PESEL status) holders. Certain conditions must be met, e.g. uninterrupted holding of UKR status for at least 365 days.\n⎯ Obligation to notify the authorities of address change within 15 business days by Ukrainian nationals holding residence permits issued in the simplified procedure.\n\nWhat it means\n\nCitizens of Ukraine residing in Poland under the Special Act will have their legal stay extended by law until 30 September 2025. It gives a sense of security and flexibility in filing for residence permit in Poland, especially by family members covered by UKR status who will finally be able to apply for family reunification. Increased office occupancy due to the number of applicants is expected due to this amendment.\n\nA particularly important change from the employer’s perspective is that the time for notification of employment of a Ukrainian citizen to the Labor Office is to be reduced to 7 days only. Employers should implement the appropriate procedures to legalize Ukrainian employees in due time. Also, careful verification of the necessity to resubmit the notification in case of any changes to the employment conditions is required. Not meeting the deadline may result in a need to terminate the employment contract.\nEmployers aiming to help their employees obtain residence permits should review their situation (e.g. confirm temporary protection status in Poland) and ensure that they are ready to submit applications in advance.\n\nHow we can help\n\nAs Vialto Partners Poland, we provide comprehensive assistance in the processes of obtaining documents legalizing work and residence of foreigners, providing immigration compliance from the perspective of both the employer and the foreigner.

        "date": "May 11, 2023",
        "content": "9 May 2023\n\nFor your mobile workforce\n\nSummary\n\nThe Albanese Government handed down its first full Federal Budget on Tuesday 9 May 2023. On the workforce front, the Budget focused on addressing cost of living pressures, implementing migration reform, and continuing the existing focus on the integrity of superannuation. Many of the measures affecting the workforce had already been announced with minimal surprises in the Budget.\n\nThe detail\n\nImmigration headlines\n\nAustralia’s net overseas migration has rebounded strongly, with migration numbers forecast to surge in FY2023 and 2024 before stabilising in the following three years. According to Budget papers, the total population is expected to be 750,000 people (2.5%) smaller in June 2031 compared with pre-pandemic forecasts. Low unemployment and increased eligibility for temporary visas support higher levels of temporary migration.\n\nThe Budget headlines for immigration are as follows:\n\nVisa application charges to increase\n\nMost fees will increase by 6%, except for subclass Temporary Work Short Stay Specialist (subclass 400) visas, Training visas, Temporary Activities visas, Visitor visas and Working Holiday visas which will increase by 15%. Business Innovation and Investment Visas (which includes the Significant Investor Visa) fees will increase by 40%.\n\nMigration compliance and enforcement\n\nToday’s Budget proposes over $125 million of funding over four years to strengthen the migration system. This includes over $48 million to support visa processing officers and over $27 million to upgrade systems and improve efficiency. Over $50 million has been pledged to strengthen the migration system, including monitoring wages and conditions via Australia’s Single Touch Payroll as suggested by the Parkinson review.\n\nIncome tax\n\nThe Albanese Government has remained silent on the previous Government’s proposed modernisation of the individual tax residency rules, as well as the Stage 3 tax cuts kicking in from 1 July 2024.\n\nFor our Kiwi neighbours\n\nThe Government will create a direct pathway to Australian citizenship for New Zealand citizens without becoming permanent residents first from 1 July 2023.\n\nCurrently, many New Zealand citizens can qualify for the temporary resident tax concessions as the non-protected Special Category visa (subclass 444) visa is considered a temporary visa. We expect that New Zealand citizens will continue to qualify for the temporary resident tax concessions until they are granted Australian citizenship, however will need to wait for legislation to be released to confirm this.\n\nIncrease on tax in superannuation\n\nThe Budget reaffirmed that the tax on earnings relating to the portion of individual superannuation balances above $3 million will be increased from 15% to 30% from 1 July 2025.\n\nSuperannuation guarantee obligations\n\nThe Budget confirmed the previously announced “Pay Day Super” changes. From 1 July 2026, payment of Superannuation Guarantee contributions will be brought forward from the current quarterly deadlines to each pay day. It remains to be seen if a payment and reporting deadline extension will be available for employees paid from a foreign payroll, as previously seen with Single Touch Payroll concessions. The government has proposed a consultation process ahead of a final plan to be included in next year’s Budget.\n\nThe Budget also includes over $40 million to fund increased data matching capabilities to identify and act on underpayments of superannuation. Wage trust is already an area of focus for the ATO, this is clearly still in the Government’s sights. It’s key for organisations with globally mobile employees to actively monitor and identify their superannuation obligations.\n\nUpdates to the immigration thresholds flagged above have a flow on effect to employee superannuation guarantee entitlements, as these thresholds exclude mandatory employer superannuation contributions (currently 10.5%, scheduled to increase to 12% from 1 July 2025).\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "UAE | Immigration | Issuance of re-entry permits",
        "date": "February 15, 2023",
        "content": "13 February 2023\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe UAE Immigration Authorities have recently announced that all mainstream UAE residence permit holders such as investors, employees and their dependents who have been outside of the country for more than six months can now secure a re-entry permit by applying through a designated online immigration portal.\n\nThe Detail\n\nAs a general rule, the residency status of an individual is automatically invalidated if the holder has been outside of the UAE for a continuous period of more than 180 days. There are a number of exceptions e.g. students, medical patients, domestic helpers of diplomats, as well as self-sponsored Golden Visa holders (amongst other exempted cases indicated on the UAE government website).\n\nHowever, as per the new re-entry permit implementation rolled out by the ICP (Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs & Port Security), residence permit holders who stay outside of the country for more than six months are now allowed to re-enter the UAE if they submit an application via the ICP portal. The applicant needs to specify a reason for exceeding the 180 day rule and approval will be granted at the sole discretion of the Immigration Authorities. ICP officials have not further specified which reasons may lead to acceptance or rejection of re-entry permit applications.\n\nWhat this means\n\nAnyone with a valid UAE Residence Permit who has stayed outside of the UAE for more than 180 days can apply for a re-entry permit through the ICP system online. Residence Permit holders will need to ensure that their visa status is active and that their residency has not expired or been canceled.\n\nResidents can apply for the re-entry permits either through accredited travel agents, through the ICP website online or through approved government service centers in the UAE. In support of their re-entry permit application, the applicant must provide a number of personal documents and pay an application fee of approximately 950 AED. Once the application is approved and the re-entry permit has been issued, the individual must re-enter the UAE within 30 days. Failure to re-enter within the stipulated time frame will incur a penalty of AED 100 for every additional 30 days spent outside of the country.\n\nEmployers will need to consider the impact of this change (e.g. WPS obligations for Mainland entities), for example in cases where employees leave the UAE to go on long term assignments beyond six months and there may be the prospect or an expectation that they will return to the UAE for work/ employment purposes\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe understand that for many companies this will require careful monitoring of employees who are traveling outside of the UAE for a longer duration. We can assist with:\n\n● Monitoring the 180 day period employees remain out of country;\n● Conduct an impact assessment based on the current employee population and advise\non the implications for employers to hold on to the deregistration of employees’\nResidence Permits while out of the country, in case there is an intention for the\nemployee to return;\n● Assist with the submission of re-entry permit applications with the ICP.\n\nContact us\n\nShould you have further questions on this update, please reach out to:\n● Rekha Simpson – Director, Middle East Immigration: rekha.simpson@vialto.com\n● Umme Salma – Senior Manager, Middle East Immigration: umme.salma@vialto.com\n● Dounia Fathi-Benbrahim – Senior Manager, Middle East Immigration:\ndounia.fathi-benbrahim@vialto.com\n● Ananth Prasad – Manager, Middle East Immigration: ananth.prasad@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "September 4, 2023",
        "content": "August 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nImpact: medium\n\nSummary\n\nAmong other things, German lawmakers have changed the process for issuing and sending the electronic residence permit, offering applicants the opportunity to significantly reduce the waiting time in the final phase of the residence law process.\n\nThe Change\n\nCurrently, applicants have to submit their in-country application either by email or online, attend an in-person appointment and have to collect the final residence permit in a third step. This entire process is taking several weeks. It’s however not only the waiting time to obtain an appointment, but it also takes several weeks to obtain the final residence permit after the appointment took place. The reason is that the residence card is printed centrally in the Federal Printing Office in Berlin and will then be send to the local immigration office at the applicant´s place of residence. Often another appointment is required to collect the final residence permit at the immigration office.\n\nDuring the application appointment the applicant will now have the option to request a direct sending of the residence card from the Federal Printing Office to his/her home address in Germany or to the address of authorized third party. The requirements are:\n\nAt the time of delivery, the identity of the applicant shall be confirmed by the deliverer by presenting one of the documents of the applicant mentioned before.

        "title": "United States I Alaska and Missouri state paid sick leave programs",
        "date": "December 17, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nSummary\n\nThis alert provides a summary of state-run programs that are set to begin soon in Alaska and Missouri.\n\nThe detail\n\nSummary\nA new paid sick leave law is set to begin in the state of Alaska on July 1, 2025. Alaska Ballot Measure No. 1 was voted for in favor in early November of 2024. Once certified by the state, the law will apply to all employers in Alaska, with differing standards applying to those employers with less than 15 employees.\n\nWhen employment begins or on July 1, 2025 – whichever is later – employees must accrue one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked. The proposed law assumes that overtime-exempt executive, administrative, professional, and outside sales employees work a 40-hour-per-week schedule, but if their typical workweek involves fewer than 40 hours they accrue leave according to their normal schedule.\n\nEmployers with less than 15 employees will be able to cap the annual accrual at 40 hours, and employers with 15 or more employees will be able to cap the annual accrual at 56 hours. The proposed law mandates that all unused leave carry over from year to year (with no designated carryover cap). There is no mention concerning whether, and in what amount, employers can cap overall accrual. However, the proposed law does allow employers with less than 15 employees to limit annual use to 40 hours, and employers with 15 or more employees to limit annual use to 56 hours.\n\nEmployers with a paid leave policy, such as a PTO policy, that make available an amount of paid leave sufficient to meet the proposed law’s requirements that employees may use for the same purposes and under the same conditions as the proposed law requires need not provide additional paid sick leave.\n\nThe proposed law does not address the rate at which employees must be paid, or when they must be paid, when using paid sick leave.\n\nSummary\nA new paid sick & safe time leave law is set to begin in the state of Missouri on May 1, 2025. Proposition A was voted for in favor in early November of 2024. Once certified by the state, the law will apply to all employers in Missouri, with differing standards applying to those employers with less than 15 employees in Missouri.\n\nWhen employment begins or on May 1, 2025 – whichever is later – employees must accrue one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked . The proposed law assumes that overtime-exempt executive, administrative, professional, and outside sales employees work a 40-hour-per-week schedule, but if their typical workweek involves fewer than 40 hours they accrue leave according to their normal schedule.\n\nThere is no mention concerning whether employers can cap annual or overall accrual. However, the proposed law does allow those employers with less than 15 employees in Missouri to limit annual use to 40 hours, and other employers can limit annual use to 56 hours. It also allows employers to limit carryover from year to year to 80 hours.\n\nEmployers with a paid leave policy, such as a PTO policy, who make available an amount of paid leave sufficient to meet the proposed law’s requirements that employees may use for the same purposes and under the same conditions as the proposed law requires need not provide additional paid sick time.\n\nWhen employees use leave, they must be paid their same hourly rate, with the same benefits – including health care benefits – that the employee typical earns, which cannot be less than the state minimum wage. For hourly employees, this is their hourly rate. For salaried employees – exempt or nonexempt – employers must divide wages they earned in the previous pay period by hours worked in that previous pay period. Although the proposed law contains numerous provisions concerning how employees must be paid, it does not mention when they must be paid when they use leave.\n\nHow we can help\n\nVialto can assist you in complying with your responsibilities related to state paid leave programs, including determining which employees are covered under the program, assisting with any required registrations, calculating employee and employer contribution amounts, drafting employee communications, and assisting with wage reporting.\n\nPlease reach out directly to your Vialto contact or one of the individuals listed below to discuss.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nTina Schrob\nPartner\n\nGregory Fetter\nPartner\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "title": "Australia | Employment Tax | New ruling on individual tax residency",
        "date": "June 16, 2023",
        "content": "June 2023\n\nGlobal Mobility Tax\n\nSummary\n\nThe Australian Taxation Office (‘ATO’) has issued Taxation Ruling TR 2023/1 to reflect the Commissioner’s view on when an individual would be considered a tax resident of Australia.\n\nThe ruling was previously released as Draft Taxation Ruling TR 2022/D2. The final ruling (TR 2023/1) takes into consideration feedback provided during a consultation period (of which Vialto Partners was involved) and has been updated to give some additional clarity and provide further examples.\n\nTR 2023/1 takes into account developments in more recent case law such as Harding v Commissioner of Taxation [2019] FCAFC 29 (‘Harding’), Pike v Commissioner of Taxation [2019] FCA 2185 (‘Pike’) and Addy v Commissioner of Taxation [2019] FCA 1768 (‘Addy’). This ruling replaces previous residency rulings IT 2650, IT 2681 and TR 98/17.\n\nThe ruling does not represent a change in legislation or the tests for residency that the previous Government announced in the May 2021 Federal Budget based on the recommendations put forward by the Board of Taxation – we are yet to see if the current Government will adopt those recommendations.\n\nThe Detail\n\nTR 2023/1 reiterates that determining if an individual is a resident of Australia requires a holistic review of the individual’s facts and circumstances.\n\nSome of the key points the Commissioner highlights in TR 2023/1 include:\n\nThe Commissioner provides a series of examples in TR 2023/1 which demonstrates how the Commissioner administers the residency tests outlined in subsection 6(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.\n\nWhat this means\n\nVialto welcomes the additional clarity in the Commissioner’s interpretation of the definition of ‘resident of Australia’ as well as the use of modern examples which take into account current living arrangements as opposed to those used in IT 2650 and TR 98/17 which were based on living arrangements at the time (more than 25 years ago). Notwithstanding the additional clarity, the following should be noted:\n\nNext steps\n\nGiven the Commissioner’s emphasis that an individual’s tax residency turns on their facts and circumstances, employers should ensure that employees obtain advice in respect of their tax residency status to ensure their obligations are being correctly met in respect of their employees. Employers should also review their employee populations, particularly employees that are in Australia on a working holiday visa, to ensure that obligations are being met correctly for such employees.\n\nAustralian domiciled individuals who are living outside Australia should also review their own facts and circumstances to determine whether they either have ongoing connections to Australia as well as maintained a permanent place of abode in Australia in light of the Commissioner’s updated views.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "United States | USCIS releases policy memo on issuance of NTAs in cases involving inadmissible and removable noncitizens",
        "date": "March 10, 2025",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nOn February 28, 2025 the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) released a policy memorandum that expands the circumstances under which USCIS will issue a Notice to Appear (NTA) to initiate removal proceedings against a noncitizen. This policy is similar to the June 2018 NTA policy memorandum from the first Trump Administration, with some notable differences.\n\nThe policy, effective immediately, expands USCIS authority to refer individuals for removal proceedings following the denial of an application for an immigration benefit, if the noncitizen is no longer lawfully present in the United States. The policy exempts beneficiaries of employment-based petitions from the policy, but does not exempt their dependent family members. The policy also expands USCIS authority to initiate removal proceedings against certain noncitizens with criminal charges, arrests, or convictions.\n\nThe detail\n\nBackground\n\nAn NTA is a charging document that begins the process of removing (i.e., deporting) a noncitizen from the United States, and instructs the noncitizen to appear before an immigration judge. An immigration judge then reviews all of the applicable evidence and the law and determines whether the noncitizen should be removed from the United States, or whether they are entitled to some form of relief to remain in the country.\n\nSeveral federal agencies within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have authority to issue NTAs, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). USCIS also has authority to issue NTAs in specific circumstances, the scope of which has been defined by USCIS policy memoranda issued by recent administrations.\n\nThe NTA policy memorandum issued in June 2018 by the first Trump Administration would have substantially expanded the scope of USCIS authority, though the policy was not implemented to its full extent while it was in effect. The Biden Administration later rescinded that policy in 2021, and reinstated the 2011 guidance which instructed USCIS to initiate removal proceedings in a more limited range of cases.\n\nThis new policy, which appears to be effective immediately, reverts back to the more expansive approach to NTA issuance from the Trump Administration’s 2018 policy, but makes an important exception for beneficiaries of employment-based petitions.\n\nThe new NTA policy and USCIS denials\n\nUnder the new NTA policy, USCIS will issue an NTA where:\n\nThe impact of this policy has severe and potentially devastating consequences. Noncitizens applying for an immigration benefit are at greater risk for NTA issuance in the event of a denial. Notably, this includes noncitizens applying for immigration benefits such as a change or extension of nonimmigrant status (Form I-539) or applications to register permanent residence or adjust status (Form I-485). While beneficiaries of employment-based petitions are exempted from NTA issuance, that exemption does not extend to their dependent family members.\n\nFraud and Misrepresentation\n\nUSCIS will issue an NTA in cases presenting substantiated fraud or material misrepresentation. When fraud or material misrepresentation is part of the record and the alien is removable, USCIS will issue an NTA upon adverse action of the benefit request, or other unfavorable determination or action. An NTA will be issued against an individual, even if the petition or application is denied for a ground other than fraud. This guidance did not originally appear in the June 2018 memo.\n\nException for beneficiaries of employment-based petitions\n\nThe new NTA policy provides an important exception for beneficiaries of employment-based petitions. Specifically, USCIS will not issue NTAs to beneficiaries of employment-based petitions where:\n\nWhile principal beneficiaries of employment-based petitions can benefit from this exception and generally will not be issued an NTA as a result of an unfavorable decision, the same exception does not extend to their dependent family members. As such, it appears that the new policy would result in USCIS initiating removal proceedings against dependent family members, but not against the principal beneficiary.\n\nCriminal cases and the 2025 NTA memo\n\nGenerally, USCIS refers cases involving criminal conduct, arrests, or convictions to ICE for enforcement action determinations, including NTA issuance. The new policy expands USCIS authority to issue an NTA if an immigration benefit request is denied or withdrawn, and directs USCIS to issue an NTA to noncitizens who have been arrested, charged with, or convicted of a criminal offense.\n\nThis represents a departure from the Biden Administration’s policy, which did not require USCIS to issue an NTA directly after a benefit request denial under such circumstances, but rather referred the case to ICE for a decision on NTA issuance.\n\nWhat will not change under the new NTA policy?\n\nUSCIS will continue to issue NTAs as required by statute or regulation and will not change the rules or policies for the following situations:\n\nTemporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients\n\nThe new policy does not change NTA or notification procedures for TPS cases as described in the regulations. USCIS will generally issue an NTA if it denies an initial or re-registration TPS application, or if the application is withdrawn and the applicant has no other lawful status or authorization to remain in the United States.\n\nIn the event that DHS terminates a country’s TPS designation, and the former TPS recipient has no other legal status or authorization to remain the United States, the policy directs USCIS to coordinate with ICE and CBP regarding the appropriate timing of any NTA issuances to former TPS beneficiaries after the country’s TPS designation ends.\n\nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients\n\nAdditionally, the new policy does not change the existing regulations that restrict the issuance of NTAs to DACA applicants after the denial of a DACA benefit request.\n\nUSCIS discretion under the new policy\n\nThe new policy states that prosecutorial discretion to not issue an NTA should only be exercised on a case-by-case basis and in “very limited and compelling instances” after consultation with a supervisor.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe impact of the new NTA policy will depend on how fully it is implemented by USCIS during the Trump Administration. The policy signals a shift toward stricter enforcement in employment-based and fraud related cases.\n\nEmployers and noncitizens should remain vigilant, ensuring compliance with all immigration requirements to mitigate the risk of possible removal proceedings. Applicants and their employers should plan on applying for immigration benefits as early as possible, and consider using expedited processing where available, to mitigate the risk of denials being issued after the noncitizen’s status has expired. Noncitizens with criminal arrests, charges, or convictions should consult an immigration lawyer to understand the potential impact of this policy to their situation. Any noncitizen who is issued an NTA should retain an immigration lawyer to help them understand and navigate the removal proceedings.\n\nIt is essential that employers and noncitizens who may be affected by this policy consult with a competent and reputable immigration lawyer, if possible, to receive the most appropriate advice for their circumstances. Vialto will continue to monitor the impact of the new NTA policy and will provide further information and guidance as developments arise.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nManish Daftari \nPartner\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "date": "February 10, 2025",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nSummary\n\nThe IRS released Revenue Ruling 2025-4, providing long awaited guidance to the taxability of contributions to and benefits paid pursuant to state paid family and medical leave (PFML) statutes.\n\nRev. Rul. 2025-4 addresses the federal income tax and federal employment tax treatment of contributions and benefits paid in certain scenarios under a state PFML statute. The highlights most pertinent to employers include the federal tax treatment of employee contributions paid by employers on behalf of employees (“employer pick-up contributions”) and the taxability and reporting requirements for certain benefits paid under state PFML statutes.\n\nIn determining the federal tax treatment of benefits paid under such statutes, the revenue ruling distinguishes between payment of benefits related to qualifying medical leave (PML) and benefits that are considered family leave (PFL), and taxability of benefits paid that are attributable to employee contributions versus employer contributions. Qualifying medical leave generally refers to time off from work taken by an eligible employee that is made necessary by the individual’s own serious health condition.

        "title": "Singapore | Foreign workforce policy updates",
        "date": "March 11, 2025",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nThe Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has provided updates to Singapore’s foreign workforce policies at Committee of Supply 2025. In summary, there is an increase in S Pass qualifying salary and levy, changes to the Work Permit framework but no change to Employment Pass qualifying salary.\n\nThe detail\n\nNew S Pass qualifying salary and levy\n\nStarting 1 September 2025, the minimum qualifying salary for the S Pass will rise from S$3,150 to S$3,300, with progressive increases based on age, reaching up to S$4,800 for candidates in their mid-40s. For the Financial Services sector, the minimum qualifying salary will increase from S$3,650 to S$3,800, progressing to S$5,650 for candidates in their mid-40s.\n\nThis new qualifying salary will apply to new S Pass applications from 1 September 2025 and to renewal applications expiring from 1 September 2026. Additionally, the S Pass Tier 1 levy will increase from $550 to $650, harmonised with the Tier 2 levy, starting 1 September 2025.\n\nChanges to the Work Permit framework\n\nCurrently, the Non-Traditional Sources (NTS) are Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand. From 1 June 2025, the NTS will expand to include Bhutan, Cambodia and Laos to allow businesses to hire skilled non- PMET, (PMET refers to professionals, managerials, executives and technicians) from more countries.\n\nThe MOM will raise the maximum Period of Employment and align the maximum employment age for current Work Permit holders with the local retirement age of 63. For new Work Permit applications, the age limit will be set to 61, two years below the local retirement age. These changes will take effect on 1 July 2025.\n\nNo change to Employment Pass (EP) qualifying salary\n\nThere are no changes to the Employment Pass qualifying salary as MOM had previously announced in Committee of Supply 2024 an increase in the EP qualifying salary, which has been implemented for new applications starting from 1 January 2025.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe increase in the minimum qualifying salary for the S Pass will mean that some employees who previously qualified for an S Pass may no longer meet the new criteria. Businesses will need to project how many current S Pass holders might fall below the new salary thresholds and if applicable, seek alternative work pass categories or possibly face the challenge of finding other qualified employees who meet the new salary thresholds. The increase in levy costs will add to the operating expenses of businesses that hire S Pass holders. Companies should proactively assess how these changes will impact their workforce composition and budgets.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nYang Li\nPartner, Immigration\n\nIrin Ou\nDirector, Immigration\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "title": "United Kingdom | Immigration | United Kingdom Immigration Changes",
        "date": "July 19, 2023",
        "content": "17th July 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nOn the 17th July 2023, the UK government announced details of upcoming changes to the Immigration Rules. Key changes include:\n\nThe changes will take effect on various dates but the rules restricting student switches to Skilled Worker to take effect almost immediately. The Home Office has departed from its usual convention of laying new rules before Parliament 21 days before they come into force and those changes came into force for applications submitted on or after 15.00 on 17 July 2023.\n\nThe Detail\n\nTightening of restrictions on Student visa rules and consequent impact on work routes\n\nMany student visa holders apply for a Skilled Worker visa before their course completion, meaning that they have their visa ready to start work after finishing their studies. This is now more complex and from 3PM on 17th July 2023, student visa holders on courses at degree level or above can only switch to a Skilled Worker visa if they have already completed their studies or where their work start date is after course completion.\n\nOn the face of it, it appears that the new rule simply changes the sequencing of when a student can apply for a Skilled Worker visa. It would not prevent that student from signing a permanent employment contract and working during the period between ending studies and course completion, so long as that period is no longer than three months. However there is a degree of ambiguity in the Rules and a more conservative interpretation would suggest that students should be placed on fixed term contracts until their Skilled Worker visas are granted. We are seeking clarification on that point.\n\nThis change forms part of the Government’s wider plans to restrict the student visa rules in an attempt to reduce overall net migration. Other significant changes include removing the right for international students to bring dependents unless, in relation to course dates on or after 1st January 2024, they are on a postgraduate course that is a PhD or other doctoral qualification, or a research-based higher degree. Student visa holders also cannot apply for permission to stay as a dependant in certain work routes unless they have completed their course of studies or have been a PhD student for at least 24 months.\n\nEU Settlement Scheme Changes\n\nEuropeans and others with five years of pre-settled status will not lose their right of residence if they fail to apply for settled status before expiry of their pre-settled status. Instead, they will be awarded an automatic 2 year extension of their status. This implements a High Court decision confirming that individuals with pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme did not lose their residence rights if they did not submit an application.\n\nThe Government has also confirmed that it intends to automatically convert eligible pre-settled status holders to settled status wherever possible. It is not yet clear who will be automatically converted, but we will provide more information when it is available.\n\nHow we can help\n\nThe Rules changes are all very technical, but could create significant challenges for employers. The rules restricting student switchers will need to be built into your graduate or milkround hiring processes. There may also be a need to train your recruiters and adapt any onboarding materials shared with graduates you intend to sponsor. Both steps are fairly practical and dependent on a more complex, legal risk question: the policy is ambiguous and a conservative interpretation could mean putting your graduate hires on fixed term contracts until they are awarded a Skilled Worker visa. We believe this is overly conservative and are seeking clarification on this point, but there is a risk that fixed term contracts become necessary. We do not recommend doing anything just yet, we hope to have the answer soon, but if you have any urgent matters please let us know.\n\nThe changes to the pre-settled status rules are welcome and helpful. Your European colleagues may already be aware of the changes but we expect many employers will want to communicate them to employees, to ensure that they know that a settled status application is preferable, understand that their leave could be automatically updated and know to contact you if they have any questions. Fairly simple comms should be sufficient in most instances, although a short webinar/ town hall may be useful for larger populations of Europeans holding pre-settled status.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "January 16, 2023",
        "content": "28 December 2022\n\nHighlight\n\nOn December 26, 2022, China’s National Health Commission announced that the novel coronavirus pneumonia will be renamed as novel coronavirus infection. The management of COVID-19 infection will be downgraded from Class A to Class B and a series of new measures will take effect from January 8, 2023 towards the COVID-19 infection. According to the announcement, the centralized quarantine as well as Health Declaration Code application for all China arrivals will be cancelled.\n\nThe Details\n\nStarting from January 8, 2023, inbound travelers to China are required to take a PCR test 48 hours before departing for China and have a negative test result. If the result shows positive, they should only travel after recovery from COVID-19. Upon arrival in China, they are required to fill out a Health Declaration Card with the PCR test result at the Customs.\n\nIn addition, the following measures will be removed after January 8, 2023:\n\nMeanwhile, the National Immigration Administration of China issued a notice on December 27, 2022 to confirm, among other things, resumption of the following policies starting from January 8, 2023:\n\nWhat this means\n\nThis is certainly a major milestone in the China’s COVID-19 control and prevention journey. While a much more flexible entry process is now in place, there are still some immigration visas/schemes remain suspended (for example, tourist visa application, visa-free policy for Singaporean, Japanese and Bruneian etc.).\n\nWe have already observed an increasing trend of inbound and outbound travellers, and now with travel restrictions have been almost fully lifted, we believe the increase for international travels is inevitable. For those who previously have Chinese visas that obtained prior to March 28, 2020 and not yet expired, it is suggested to check and confirm if the visas remain valid and seek professional support where necessary.\n\nFinally, companies should continue to pay close attention to the latest changes of the relevant policies on COVID-19 control measures and immigration policy. It is also recommended to review the mobility policy, deployment model, compensation strategy, tax arrangement and remote work policy etc. and make any necessary changes and updates.\n\nContact us\n\nPlease reach out to your usual Vialto Partners contact should you have any questions on the above.

        "title": "United Kingdom | Immigration | Publication of the Shortage Occupation List review, with 8 occupations added",
        "date": "October 5, 2023",
        "content": "04 October 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nImpact Medium\n\nSummary\n\nThe Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) has published its report, following a major review of the Shortage Occupation List (SOL). This report follows a public consultation, where employers could submit evidence of the occupations they considered should be added to the SOL.\n\nKey recommendations coming from the report include:\n– 8 occupations should be added to the UK-wide SOL, including 3 occupations from the construction sector.\n– 2 occupations should be added to the Scotland-only SOL.\n– The SOL should not contain RQF 1-2 (lower skilled) occupations, despite the Government providing scope to do so.\n– Care workers and senior care workers should remain on the SOL.\n\nLastly, the MAC has also taken a fundamental look at the what the purpose of the SOL and the benefits are of being included. From this they have recommended that the SOL is abolished. If the Government chooses to retain it, they recommend that the name be changed to be the Immigration Salary Discount List (ISDL).\n\nThe Detail\n\nA substantial part of the report focuses on the purpose of the SOL in the UK Immigration system. It outlines the benefits of being on the SOL, which are substantially lower now than in previous years due to changes in the Immigration Rules. The report includes recommendations for future SOL reviews, including either abolishing the SOL or reforming it to address the issue of low-wage employers paying below the general threshold for the Sponsored Worker visa route.\n\n– The discount (80%) to the going rate salary is removed. This discount allows employers to pay below the going rate when recruiting for an occupation on the SOL.\nThe MAC has previously made this recommendation but it has not been accepted by the Government.\n– All occupations on a national pay scale, alongside those where the going rate exceeds the SOL general threshold (£20,960), be made ineligible for the SOL.\n– If granted the right to work, asylum seekers should be able to work in any job.\n– Sponsorship rules for the Creative Worker visa route are updated, with the reference to the SOL being removed and to allow employers to sponsor any occupation that is currently eligible for the Skilled Worker route without having to perform a labour market test.\n– The Home Office attaches a minimum salary threshold to the Create Worker visa.\n\nOccupations recommended to be added to the SOL\n\nRecommended additions to the UK-wide SOL:\n– Laboratory technicians (SOC code 3111)\n– Pharmaceutical technicians (SOC code 3217)\n– Bricklayers and masons (SOC code 5312)\n– Roofers, roof tilers and slaters (SOC code 5313)\n– Construction and building trades n.e.c (SOC code 5319)\n– Animal care services occupations n.e.c (SOC code 6139)\n– Care workers and home carers (SOC code 6145) – to remain on the SOL\n– Senior care workers (SOC code 6146) – to remain on the SOL\n\nRecommended additions to the Scotland-only SOL:\n\n– Managers and proprietors in forestry, fishing and related services (SOC code 1213)\n– Boat and ship builders and repairers (SOC code 5236)\n\nOccupations recommended for reclassification\n\nThe role of Sommeliers (SOC code 9273) was recommended for reclassification to RQF 3+ within the existing SOC code. This would make the Sponsored Worker route available, with eligibility restricted to individuals with 3 of more years of full-time experience.\n\nRQF 1-2 occupations\n\nMany RQF 1-2 occupations were reviewed but the MAC concluded that only Care workers and home carers (SOC code 6145) should be added. No further occupations at RQF 1-2 were added to the SOL. This was due to insufficient evidence being provided showing both the shortage and evidence of attempts to alleviate the shortage. In relation to Farm Workers (SOC code 9111), the report referred to the current review being undertaken by the MAC into the Seasonal Worker Visa and commented that the needs of the sector will be reviewed as part of this.\n\nThe occupations covered in detail include: Scaffolders, stagers and riggers (SOC code 8141), Crane drivers (SOC code 8221), Mobile machine drivers and operatives (SOC 8229), Pharmacy and other dispensing assistants (SOC code  7114), Electroplaters (SOC code 8118), Routine Inspectors and Testers (SOC code 8133), Sewing machinists (SOC code 8137), Hairdressers and barbers (SOC code 6221), Large Goods Vehicle drivers (SOC code 8211), Bus and coach drivers (SOC code 8213), Shelf fillers (SOC code 9251) and Farm Workers (SOC code 9111).\n\nWhat this means\n\nWe welcome this report and the clear recommendations from the MAC. However, no changes will take place until the Government accepts the report in part or in whole and therefore in the meantime uncertainty remains for the impacted occupations.\n\nIf you sponsor workers on the Shortage Occupation List you needn’t do anything just yet.\nThe Government needs to review the report and decide whether to accept their recommendations. In the short term that should have no impact, because jobs are not being removed from the list. That may change in the medium to long term, but we will need to see if the Government abolishes the SOL, changes the name or does nothing.\n\nIf you wish to sponsor workers in any of the job categories being added, you may want to communicate the recommendations to the business. The Government tends to accept these recommendations, but we would suggest caution and that you are clear that it will be at least several weeks, perhaps longer, before we know for certain.\n\nThe report provides guidance to organisations considering making submissions for future Calls for Evidence from the MAC and what evidence is required to be successful. This should help ensure any organisations doing so spend their time wisely.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWhen a job is being added, Vialto can perform an analysis of your job description against the SOC code, with an assessment of cost per sponsored worker and minimum salaries.\n\nIf the Home Office accepts the recommendation to remove most benefits of the SOL, particularly salary discount, then some assessment will be needed of the impact on minimum salaries for sponsored workers. Our assessment would consider the impact on future hires and extensions.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n• Andrea Als, UK Director and Solicitor | andrea.als@vialto.com\n• Lyudmyla Davies, UK Partner and Solicitor | lyudmyla.davies@vialto.com\n• Jennifer Harryman, UK Senior Manager | jennifer.harryman@vialto.com\n• Ian Robinson, UK Partner | ian.j.robinson@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&amp;R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "November 7, 2023",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nMalaysia | MIRB issues updated e-Invoice guidelines\n\nSummary\nElectronic invoicing, known as e-Invoice, is a digital representation of a transaction between businesses and consumers that replaces conventional paper or electronic documents for invoices, credit notes and debit notes. As part of the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board (MIRB)’s’ digitisation agenda and to facilitate tax return filing through seamless system integration for efficient and accurate tax reporting, e-Invoice is expected to be implemented in stages from 1 August 2024 with the aim of achieving full deployment on 1 January 2027.\n\nThe Detail\nThe MIRB has recently issued the following guidelines on 29 September 2023 which provide additional coverage of the e-Invoice concept and specific, step-by-step guidance on the e-Invoice workflow:\n\nWhile the guidelines mainly cover Business-to-Business (B2), Business-to-Consumer (B2C) and Business-to-Government (B2G) transactions, the MIRB has also confirmed that e-invoices (including self-billed e-Invoices) are not required for employment income and pensions (among other items), though this exemption will be reviewed and updated by the MIRB from time to time.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, e-Invoice Specific Guideline Version 1.0 indicates that to facilitate reimbursement of employment perquisites and benefits, and business expenses to employees, employees would need to get e-invoices issued in the employer’s name to the extent possible (and if not, then to the employees themselves).\n\nBelow we set out the salient points of the types of payments that will require an e-Invoice to be issued by the Supplier:\n\n\n\nGenerally, to facilitate the issuance of the e-invoice to the individuals by the suppliers, buyers are required to provide the tax identification number, identity card number (for Malaysians only) and passport numbers (for non-Malaysians only). Additionally, e-invoices must be requested from the supplier within the month of the transaction, otherwise the supplier can deny the issuance of the e-invoice to the buyer. The detailed process on the e-Invoice issuance can be found in the guidance – see version 2.0 and version 1.0.\n\nWhat this means\nIn brief, the implementation of e-Invoicing will streamline the tax reporting process and submission of data electronically to the IRB. While this does not impact employment income reporting or employer obligations, it will impact the administrative process of employee claims on the part of both Malaysian employers and employees. As such, employees must possess a thorough understanding of the e-Invoice workflow while the employers are required to strategise the adoption of accounting and payroll software that aligns with the MIRB’s requirements to facilitate the e-Invoice submissions. Consequently, employers may wish to seek guidance and insights to navigate the best practices for different transactions to comply with the MIRB’s requirements.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nHilda Liow\nPartner\n\nLim Phing Phing\nPartner\n\nWee Lay Har\nDirector\n\nHuang I-Hsiang\nSenior Manager\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

As a result, it will no longer be possible to easily contractually exclude liability for illegal employment by the direct (sub)contractors. Up to now, it was still unclear when this legislation would enter into force as this was made dependent on a ministerial decision foreseeing the practical implementation. Just before the elections of last weekend, the ministerial decision was published in the Belgian gazette. As of 2025, contractors (not the ultimate clients) could be obliged to carry out specific checks when working with subcontractors. Beware of be chained!\n\nThe detail\n\nSlipping through the meshes of the net\n\nThe law of 30 April 1999 on the employment of foreign workers and the decree of 30 April 2004 lays down some very specific obligations for companies working with subcontractors. For example, a contractor can be fined between EUR 600 and EUR 6000 and imprisoned for up to six months if he works with a subcontractor who has not checked beforehand whether a foreign employee has a valid residence permit or who has not kept a copy of this permit or authorisation for the duration of the employment in Belgium. This liability is deviant from the liability for ‘ultimate clients’, who only can be sanctioned if they are aware of the illegal employment by their subcontractor.\n\nHowever, currently, there is still an important exception. If the contractor (not the ultimate client) is in possession of a written declaration from the subcontractor confirming that the subcontractor will not employ employees (third-country nationals) who do not have a valid residence permit, the contractor will not be sanctioned. This exemption does not apply if it can be proved that the contractor had knowledge of the infringement. Consequently, the chain liability can easily be shortened at present by providing for such a declaration.\n\nCurtailing the meshes of the net\n\nBy introducing the decree amending the law of 30 April 1999 on the employment of foreign workers, the decree on social supervision of 30 April 2004 and the decree of 22 December 2017 containing a premium to encourage the transition of job seekers to entrepreneurship, the Flemish Parliament wanted to straighten out the chain liability and thus ‘curtailing the meshes of the net’ by making it more difficult for contractors to escape their liability.\n\nThe new decree foresees an increase in the duty of care of contractors (not ultimate clients). When awarding contracts, the exemption will only apply if (i) the contractor is in possession of a written declaration from the direct subcontractor stating that the latter has not employed illegally staying third- country nationals and (ii) the contractor has acted with the necessary diligence to prevent the direct subcontractor from employing illegally staying third-country nationals. Such due diligence means that the contractor must ask for (and receive) specific information on the identification of the subcontractor and its employees (e.g. their personal data and information on their residence status and residence permit).\n\nThe entrance into force of the articles related to chain liability in the Flemish decree, was made dependent on the draft of a ministerial decision. This ministerial decision was published in the Belgian Gazette on 4 June 2024 and foresees an entry into force of the Flemish Decree as of 1 January 2025.\n\nAmbitious initial checklist chained by GDPR\n\nNow the ministerial decision has been published, a final list of documents that should be kept available by the contractor with regard to the (employees of) the subcontractor has been published. Important in this respect is that – although the initial ideas were very ambitious, the ultimate checklist seems to be rather limited. For example, in preparation of the ministerial decision, judicial advice had been sought with regard to the inclusion of employment contracts to this list. The obligation to keep a copy of the employment contract available has not made the list, as it would not be considered as ‘proportional’ in the context of GDPR legislation.\n\nAccording to the ministerial decision, a distinction should be made between employees (and self- employed) for whom the ‘Van der Elst’ exemption is applied and all other non-EEA nationals.\n\nThe Van der Elst exemption is a temporary exemption to the obligation to have a Belgian work permit, for employees (and self-employed) temporarily seconded to Belgium and legally residing for more than three months in another country of the EEA and Switzerland.\n\nFor employees (and self-employed) for whom a Van der Elst exemption is applied, the contractor should ask for a copy of the passport, a copy of the residence permit, a copy of the Limosa and a copy of the A1 document. It concerns the documents necessary to prove the fulfillment of the conditions to apply a Van der Elst exemption according to the case law of the European Court of Justice. If no A1 document has been provided yet, it is sufficient to have a proof of application.\n\nFor all other employed (and self-employed) nationals of non-EEA countries or Switzerland, the contractor should ask for a copy of the passport, a copy of the residence permit, a copy of the work permit and (if applicable) a copy of the DIMONA declaration.\n\nIf a contractor does not receive the necessary information, he must explicitly ask the subcontractor for it again. If he still does not receive it, he will be obliged to inform the social inspectorate. A contractor who does not perform the necessary checks by taking into account the necessary duty of care (and thus by not contacting the social inspectorate in case of non-compliance), might face the sanctions as described above.\n\nHow can we help you to unleash the chain?\n\nAlthough employing non-EEA nationals in Belgium might already be complex, working with non-EEA national contractors (or non-EEA national employees of contractors) might be extremely complex. Vialto Partners can assist you in ensuring compliance with Belgian legislation, by reviewing your internal processes, drafting contracts and providing all kind of guidance for compliance teams.

        "date": "November 20, 2024",
        "content": "As of January 19, 2025, the two-year settlement agreement reached in Edakunni v. Mayorkas expires, which means that USCIS is no longer required to expedite the adjudication of H-4/H-4 EAD and L-2 dependent applications that are filed concurrently with the I-129 for the primary worker. Should USCIS revert to prior processing practices where dependent applications are adjudicated separately, lengthy processing delays can be anticipated, potentially resulting in loss of work authorization for L-2 and H-4 spouses.\n\nHistorically, USCIS’s policy was to adjudicate H-4 and L-2 dependent applications around the same time as the concurrently filed I-129 petition for the H-1 or L-1 primary worker as a courtesy regardless of whether the I-129 was filed with regular or premium processing. Thus, dependent applications, which are not eligible for premium processing, could benefit from expedited adjudication when “bundled” with the I-129 for the H-1 or L-1 worker.\n\nIn March 2019, however, USCIS added a biometrics requirement to all Form I-539 applications, which made simultaneous adjudications impossible Thus, the I-539 and I-765 were “unbundled” for processing even if they were concurrently filed with the I-129. As a result, many H-4 and L-2 dependents waited 6-12 months or more for their applications to be approved. (The processing time for standalone H-4, H-4 EAD, and L-2 filings remains similar as demonstrated by the current USCIS processing times.) The lengthy wait time often resulted in loss of employment for L-2 spouses and H-4 spouses awaiting the adjudication of their H-4 and H-4 EAD applications.\n\nIn April 2021, a group of H-4 and L-2 holders filed a lawsuit against the Secretary of Homeland Security, Edakunni v. Mayorkas, alleging that the delay was unlawful and caused loss of employment. In January 2023, a settlement agreement was reached. As part of the two-year agreement, USCIS was required to bundle the adjudication of the I-539 and I-765 with the I-129, expediting adjudication (especially when the I-129 was filed with premium processing). The settlement agreement is set to expire on January 18, 2025, allowing USCIS to revert to prior practices.\n\nEmployers should anticipate delays in the adjudications of H-4, H-4 EAD, and L-2 applications, and consequently significant interruptions in H-4 and L-2 work authorization, when the Edakunni settlement’s “bundling” provision expires on January 18, 2025.\n\nWhile USCIS could choose to continue with the simultaneous adjudication of dependent status and work authorization after the settlement agreement expires on January 18, 2025, it seems unlikely it will do so, especially as the term of the Biden administration will end on January 20th. It is anticipated that the incoming Trump administration will likely not continue to adjudicate the dependent status and work authorization together.\n\nFor ongoing commentary and analysis relating to the potential changes to US immigration, tax, and global mobility, visit the 2024 US Election Insights hub.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nManish Daftari\nPartner\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Hungary | Immigration | Application for residence card without the need to pass the cultural knowledge exam in Hungarian—the deadline is coming!",
        "date": "April 23, 2024",
        "content": "The National Residence Card or the EU Residence Card, formerly known as the National or EU Settlement Permit, is a foreign residency status that provides numerous advantages for third-country nationals who have been continuously residing in Hungary for years. However, as of January 1, 2025, this status can be obtained only after passing a cultural knowledge exam in Hungarian.\n\nThe requirements for obtaining the Residence Card and the former Settlement Permit are fundamentally similar, but as of January 2025, a significant new element will be introduced into the legislation: in order to successfully apply for both the National and the EU Residence Card, foreign nationals will need to demonstrate that they meet the conditions of social coexistence, which they can do by successfully passing a Hungarian language cultural knowledge exam. The cultural knowledge exam is based on strict rules and predefined subject areas, including, among others, knowledge of Hungary’s history, law, and politics. Since the provision only comes into effect on January 1, 2025, until the end of 2024, foreign nationals still have the opportunity to apply for a National Residence Card or EU Residence Card without completing the cultural knowledge exam.\n\nThird-country nationals are eligible for a National Residence Card – among other requirements – if they have resided lawfully and continuously in the territory of Hungary for at least 3 years immediately preceding the submission of the application, with ensured housing, livelihood, and healthcare, and they must possess a valid, specified type of residence permit. The requirements for applying for an EU Residence Card are similar, however, a minimum of 5 years of prior residence in Hungary is necessary, with the possibility of including periods spent in other EU member state(s) within these 5 years, subject to certain conditions being met. Both the application processes for the National and EU Residence Cards are lengthy, spanning several months, sometimes even up to half a year, and much depends on whether the application is adequately prepared.\n\nIn the case of a successful application, third-country nationals can gain numerous advantages over what a residence permit offers by acquiring either the National Residence Card or the EU Residence Card. This card is issued for a longer period, typically 5 years, although it needs renewal, the status itself (which may be revoked in certain cases) entitles the holder to indefinite residency. Another advantage is that with the residence card, an indefinite-term employment contract can be established with the third- country national employee, thus, from a labor law perspective, the conditions for terminating the employment relationship are more favorable compared to foreign nationals with a residence permit and a fixed-term employment contract. Furthermore, there is no need to apply for a new permit in case of possible changes in the circumstances of employment, such as a new workplace or promotion. It’s also worth mentioning that minor children with a residence card are entitled to access state-provided healthcare services, and as adults – even without employment – this opportunity is available after 1 year following the acquisition of the residence card for a small monthly fee (11,300 forints in 2024).\n\nIt is also noteworthy that obtaining the National Residence Card or the EU Residence Card opens the door to applying for Hungarian citizenship in the future. As a general rule, Hungarian citizenship requires living in Hungary for at least 8 years, which must be verified with an address card. While traditional residence permits do not come with an address card (only with an accommodation certificate), the National/EU Residence Card does.\n\nTaking into account all these advantages, if there is a third-country national who has been living in Hungary for at least 3 years, it is worth considering applying for a residence card until this can be done without the need to pass the cultural knowledge exam in Hungarian.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact.

        "title": "European Union | Immigration | Delay in implementation of EES and ETIAS",
        "date": "January 25, 2023",
        "content": "24 January 2023\n\nImpact High\n\nSummary\n\nThe implementation date from the Entry/Exit System (EES) has been further postponed from May 2023 to November 2023. This may also result in a delay in the implementation the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), which is currently set for late 2023.\n\nThe Detail\n\nThe implementation of the Entry/Exit System (EES), which is taking place together with the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) by the European Union as part of the 2016 Smart Borders Package, has been postponed again to end of 2023. The EES is an IT system for the automatic monitoring of the border crossings of third-country nationals into the EU. The system will be installed at the external border crossing points of the Schengen Area (e.g. seaports, airports, land crossing points). This system will replace current manual processes, such as the physical stamping of passports.\n\nThe EES is closely connected to ETIAS, which is a registration system for visa-exempt visitors travelling to the EU/EFTA/Schengen area. Travellers who are visa-exempt for short stays (up to 90 days in a rolling 180 day period) may currently simply enter the Schengen area on the basis of their passports and will be stamped upon entry and exit. However, once ETIAS goes live, those nationals will generally be required to complete an online registration form prior to travel. The authorisation will be valid for 3 years and will allow them to enter and exit the Schengen area freely as long as the 90 days’ stay in 180 days is not exceeded. Travellers will be required to include personal details on the form, including education, occupation, travel history and criminal antecedents (if applicable), and pay a fee of EUR 7 per person.\n\nThe main aim of ETIAS and EES is to more efficiently and diligently manage cross-border movement to and from the EU and prevent cross-border crime and terrorism. While it will practically impact many travellers who are currently permitted to enter the Schengen area simply on the basis of their passports without prior registrations being required, it is not expected that it will restrict travel for any particular group.\n\nInitially due to launch in 2022, the implementation of EES was delayed until May 2023 and ETIAS would subsequently go live at the end of 2023. It is now understood that EES and ETIAS will both launch before the end of 2023.\n\nThe cause for the delay is likely concerns from member states regarding the practical operability of EES, especially at busy airports during the summer months. With EES requiring travellers to provide their fingerprints, which is a new step in the border crossing procedure, it may be that the delay will allow for more time to implement the necessary processes and systems to ensure a steady flow of travellers through border controls. With the launch of ETIAS being closely linked to the launch of EES, further delays cannot be excluded.\n\nWhat this means?\n\nWe advise employers to be aware of the upcoming changes with ETIAS and EES and to make sure their mobile workforce are informed of any actions they may need to take prior to travelling. In the meantime, entry requirements and border crossing processes into the EU/Schengen area remain unchanged.\n\nHow we can help\n\nVialto Team is continually monitoring developments and will provide further updates in due course.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n• Hugo Vijge, Senior Manager, Europe Immigration Advisory Lead | hugo.vijge@vialto.com\n• Stefan Lang, Manager | stefan.v.lang@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "February 3, 2023",
        "content": "02 February 2023\n\nSummary\n\nThe Hon’ble Finance Minister (FM) of India presented the Union Budget 2023 on 1 February 2023. In this update we mention below the key proposals pertaining to personal tax as announced therein.\n\nProposals in detail\n\nPersonal Tax Rates\n\n• There is no change in the tax rates under the Old Tax Regime (OTR).\n• New Personal Tax Regime (NPTR) will be the default regime. The taxpayers have an option to continue under the OTR. However, persons having business or professional income can make this choice only once.\n• Amendments in NPTR:\n➢ For Resident taxpayers, 100% tax rebate on income up to ₹7 lakh (0.7 million) as against ₹5 lakh (0.5 million) earlier\n➢ Standard deduction of ₹50,000 for salaried individuals and pensioners\n➢ Deduction of up to ₹15,000 allowed on family pension\n➢ Maximum surcharge rate reduced to 25% from 37% for income exceeding ₹5 crore (50 million) reducing the maximum marginal rate to 39% from 42.74%\n\n• Revised effective tax rates [including surcharge and cess] at illustrative income levels:\n\n\n\n* Changes in the tax rates have been highlighted in the above table\n\n\n\nCapital Gains\n\n• Conversion of physical form of Gold into Electronic Gold Receipt (EGR) or vice versa not to be considered as “transfer” of asset. Hence, no capital gain would arise on such conversion. At the time of sale of the converted asset, for the purposes of computing capital gains, the aggregate period of holding and cost of acquisition of original asset (Gold/ EGR) will be considered.\n• Where any interest paid on housing loan has been claimed as deduction for computing the income from house property, such interest is not to be included in the cost of acquisition/ improvement for computing capital gains on sale of such house property.\n• Capital gains arising from the transfer / redemption / maturity of Market Linked Debentures (MLD) to be taxable as short-term capital gains irrespective of the holding period. MLD has been specifically defined.\n• Capital gains arising on sale of residential house property and reinvested in new residential property are eligible for exemption subject to the cost of the new property. It is now proposed that if the cost of the new asset exceeds ₹10 Crores (100 million), the cost will be deemed to be capped at ₹10 crores. Similar cap is proposed for capital gains exemption available on sale of any other long term capital asset invested in new residential property.\n\nIncome from Other Sources\n\n• Under existing provisions, money paid / Indian property transferred by a Resident to a Non- Resident in excess of ₹50,000 is subject to tax. These provisions will now be applicable to ‘Resident but Not Ordinarily Resident’ recipients as well.\n• Any payment from Life Insurance policy(s) [other than Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP) and Keyman Insurance] issued on or after 1 April 2023, having annual premium exceeding ₹5 lakh (0.5 million) (in any year during the term of the policy) would be taxable net of premium paid, except in case of death of insured person.\n\n\n\nTax deducted at source (TDS) / Tax collected at source (TCS)\n\n• TDS rate reduced to 20% from 30% on withdrawal of accumulated balance under the Employees’ Provident Fund Scheme, 1952 in absence of Permanent Account Number of the individual withdrawing the balance.\n• TDS rate applicable on payment of income from units of mutual funds to Non-Residents reduced to the lower of 20% or the rate applicable under the relevant Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement, subject to furnishing of Tax Residency Certificate.\n• TCS rate on overseas remittance for medical and education retained. However, TCS rate on overseas remittances under Liberalised Remittance Scheme and payment to seller of an overseas tour package increased to 20% from 5% effective 01 July 2023, without any threshold.\n\n\n\nOther proposals\n\n• Exemption limit for leave encashment (for non-government salaried employees) on retirement increased to ₹25 lakh (2.5 million) from ₹3 lakh (0.3 million). Notification to be issued separately.\n• Timeline for tax authorities to complete assessment proceedings changed as follows:\n➢ Updated Tax Return: 12 months from the end of FY in which such return is filed\n➢ Other than Updated Tax Return: Increased from 9 months to 12 months\n• For reassessment proceedings, timeline of 3 months prescribed for filing tax return in response to the notice issued.\n• Under presumptive taxation, turnover limits enhanced to ₹75 lakh (7.5 million) from ₹50 lakh (5 million) for specified professionals and to ₹3 crore (30 million) from ₹2 crore (20 million) for certain eligible business, subject to conditions prescribed.\n\n\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n• Ishita Sengupta, Partner and India Leader | ishita.sengupta@vialto.com\n• Sundeep Agarwal, Partner | sundeep.agarwal@vialto.com\n• Ravi Jain, Partner | ravi.jain@vialto.com\n• Anand Dhelia, Partner | anand.dhelia@vialto.com\n• Chander Talreja, Partner | chander.talreja@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "June 28, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nUS | State Paid Family Leave Programs and Vermont Child Care Contribution Updates\n\nSummary\n\nThis is an update to our Alert issued December 2023, as the expansion or inception of state-run programs to provide employee continued wages during illness for themselves or a family member continues. This alert provides a summary of state-run programs that are set to begin soon in Delaware, Maryland, Maine, Minnesota, and Vermont.\n\nThe detail\n\nDelaware – Family and Medical Leave Insurance program\n\nAll Delaware employers with 10 or more employees are required to participate in Delaware’s Family and Medical Leave Insurance program beginning January 1, 2025.\n\nThe employer is responsible for all contributions required by the program. The contributions are based on an employee’s earnings up to the Social Security limit. The rates are guaranteed through 2026 at 0.8% of wages, and component rates are available for each line of coverage. Employers can require their employees to pay up to 50% of the cost of the program.\n\nEmployers with 10 or more employees may opt out of the Delaware Paid Leave plan if they purchase a private plan that provides the same or better benefits as the state plan. The private plan can be either an admitted carrier’s approved insurance plan or a self-insured program. Employers who wish to use a private benefit plan to offer paid leave benefits to their employees must obtain the Division’s approval and opt out of the Delaware Paid Leave program on a yearly basis. The first opt-in/opt-out period is September 1 through December 1, 2024.\n\nEmployees can begin receiving leave insurance benefits on January 1, 2026.\n\nMaryland – Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) program\n\nMaryland’s FAMLI program was established through the Time to Care Act passed. Any worker in the State who has worked 680 hours over the previous four calendar quarters would be considered covered.\n\nEmployers will be required to enroll in the State Plan or seek approval for a private plan that provides benefits equal to or greater than the State Plan.\n\nEmployer and employee contributions are required beginning July 1, 2025. Please note that this change to the effective date was updated by a bill passage in April 2024. As such, payroll deductions will begin July 1, 2025, for employers participating in the State Plan. Those first payroll deductions from workers and employers will then be submitted to the State by October 2025.\n\nThe State plan contribution rate was set on October 1, 2023, which is 0.9% of covered wages up to the Social Security wage cap. The rate will be equally divided between employers and employers with 15 or more workers. Employers with 14 or fewer employees are not required to contribute but will still collect payments from their workers. Employers may collect up to the full amount from employees. Employers can choose to pay the full contribution amount as an added employee benefit.\n\nWhile the Department of Labor sets the contribution rate for the State Plan, private plans will set their own rates. Employees cannot be charged more in a private plan than they would be through the State Plan.\n\nEmployees can begin receiving leave insurance benefits on July 1, 2026.\n\nMaine – Family and Medical Leave program\n\nEmployer and employee contributions are required for Maine’s Family and Medical Leave program beginning January 1, 2025. For calendar years 2025-2027, the combined contribution rate is set at either 0.5% or 1%of wages based on the size of the employer. Employers with 15 or more employees will contribute 1% of wages and may deduct up to half of the contribution from the employees’ wages.\n\nEmployers with less than 15 employees will contribute 0.5% of wages and may deduct the entire amount from the employees’ wages.\n\nEmployees can begin receiving leave insurance benefits on May 1, 2026.\n\nMinnesota – Family and Medical Leave program\n\nEmployer and employee contributions are required for Minnesota’s Family and Medical Leave program beginning January 1, 2026. The program premium rate is currently set at 0.7% of an employee’s taxable wages capped at the annual Social Security limit. The Minnesota Paid Leave Law was amended in the 2024 legislature to require an independent actuarial analysis to set the initial and subsequent year tax rates.\n\nEmployers may charge a maximum of half this premium (or 0.35%) to their employees through a wage deduction.\n\nEmployers are required to submit the first wage detail reports on October 31, 2024, and will be based on wages paid between July 1, 2024, and September 30, 2024, these reports are for information purposes only and no premiums are to be paid.\n\nEmployees can begin receiving leave insurance benefits on January 1, 2026.\n\nVermont – Child Care Contribution\n\nVermont’s Child Care Contribution (CCC) newly enacted payroll tax is effective July 1, 2024. The new law makes major investments in Vermont’s childcare system, implementing changes in both early childhood and school age settings.\n\nThe rate is 0.44% on wage income and 0.11% on self-employment income. Employers are responsible to pay a 0.44% payroll tax on all wages earned in Vermont. Employers have the option to deduct and withhold 25% of the required contribution (i.e., 0.11%) from employee wages. Payment of the Vermont CCC should be made in the same way employer’s remit their Vermont Income Tax Withholding. The CCC applies to wages earned while physically performing services in Vermont that are subject to Vermont income tax withholding, including for nonresident short term business travelers to Vermont.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nTina Schrob\nPartner\n\nGreg Fetter\nPartner\n\nLigeia Donis\nPartner\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nSummary\n\nIn a letter dated November 11, 2024, the Federal Ministry of Finance replaced its previous letter of June 30, 1997 on the wage tax treatment of employer expenses for employees at risk of safety (safety measures). The new regulations apply in all open cases.\n\nDetails\n\nIf the employer bears or reimburses expenses for safety measures for employees who are exposed to a specific risk due to their professional position, the following applies according to the BMF letter of November 11, 2024:\n\nExpenses for people exclusively involved in the personal protection of employees (e.g. bodyguards, security) are mainly granted in the employer’s own business interests and are therefore not taxable wages.\n\nExpenditure on safety equipment in rented apartments or employee-owned homes must be assessed on a case-by-case basis based on the degree of risk.\n\nA later change in the risk level classifications only affects taxation if it occurs in the year in which the safety devices were installed.\n\nWhether the safety devices become the employee’s property is irrelevant for wage tax purposes.\n\nThe corresponding wage tax consequences of the installation costs must be applied to operating and maintenance costs. They may be subject to tax in proportion to the taxable share of the total installation costs.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMathias Schmitt\nTax Advisor / Partner\n\nAnna Liepelt\nTax Advisor / Senior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

Juni 1997 zur lohnsteuerlichen Behandlung von Aufwendungen des Arbeitgebers für sicherheitsgefährdete Arbeitnehmer (Sicherheitsmaßnahmen) ersetzt.

Leibwächter, Personenschützer) werden überwiegend im eigenbetrieblichen Interesse des Arbeitgebers gewährt und sind mithin nicht steuerpflichtiger Arbeitslohn.\n\nAufwendungen für Sicherheitseinrichtungen in Mietwohnungen oder Wohneigentum der Arbeitnehmer sind nach Gefährdungsgrad im Einzelfall zu bewerten.\n\nEine spätere Änderung der Einstufungen in die Gefährdungsstufen wirkt sich nur auf die Besteuerung aus, wenn sie in dem Jahr erfolgt, in dem die Sicherheitseinrichtungen verbaut wurden.\n\nOb die Sicherheitseinrichtungen in das Eigentum des Arbeitnehmers übergehen, ist für die lohnsteuerliche Behandlung unerheblich.\n\nBei Betriebs- und Wartungskosten sind die entsprechenden lohnsteuerlichen Konsequenzen der Einbaukosten anzuwenden.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nQatar | Update to the current employment contract registration and authentication process\n\nSummary\n\nThe Ministry of Labour has revised the steps involved in the employment contract registration and authentication, with the aim of streamlining and expediting the process.\n\nThe Detail\n\nIn an effort to enhance and streamline processes in Qatar the Ministry of Labour has recently revised its procedures in relation to the employment contract registration and authentication process. Previously, subsequent to contract generation, a manual hard copy was required to be furnished to the employee for review and physical signatures would be required by both the employer and employee.\n\nThe new process allows employees to electronically access and endorse contract particulars by enrolling through the National Authentication system (NAS), a government authentication platform, allowing individuals to validate their signature digitally. NAS is used to authenticate the digital identity of individuals holding a residence permit, facilitating secure access to e-government services. Employers are advised to notify their employees to create an account via the NAS platform using the following link, to be able to validate their signature digitally: www.nas.gov.qa.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe new digitalized process is anticipated to refine and accelerate the contract authentication process. Nevertheless, employers could experience a delay during the initial deployment of the system if there are implementation challenges which will impact the overall processing times for a work permit/residence permit.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe anticipate further amendments to be introduced by the government to existing services which are linked to the overall Immigration process, and it is imperative to stay up to date on these developments. Our team will continue to closely monitor and provide timely guidance on any new updates announced by the government.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnir Chatterji\nEMEA Immigration Partner\n\nRekha Simpson\nDirector, Middle East Immigration\n\nMarilyn Serrao\nSenior Associate, Middle East Immigration\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nContact us on the following address – me-immigration@vialto.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

This convention supports business and trade by ensuring that cross-border workers and their employers are only liable to pay social security contributions in only one state at a time.\n\nThe convention entered into force effective 1 January 2024 following compilation of all necessary statutory and constitutional requirements.\n\nIn detail\nThe UK and the EFTA countries have signed an agreement which will benefit individuals who live and work abroad in any of the associated countries, by ensuring they are able to receive healthcare cover and uprated state pensions, amongst other social security entitlements. It will also allow eligible individuals travelling these countries to access necessary healthcare when abroad using a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) or the Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC). This agreement serves to close the ‘gap’ in social security coordination with these locations which arose as a result of the UK’s departure from the European Union and withdrawal from European social security coordination rules.\n\nThe EFTA agreement now forms part of the overall UK touching social security coordination rules with European countries, alongside:\n\nThe takeaway\nThe EFTA agreement aims to update the previous agreement between the UK and EFTA countries to ensure that more workers are covered by social security elements while working between these countries.\n\nTo date and since Brexit, Social Security coordination between the countries in question has been determined in line with underlying bilateral agreements (except for Lichtenstein) and largely based on outdated coordination principles constructed prior to the EU regulations.\n\nThe EFTA agreement now provides up-to-date coordination principles for movement between these countries, more in line with existing regulations used across wider Europe.\n\nFor any organizations that have individuals working in/from these countries, we recommend that a review of their social security situations is completed to determine what impact this new agreement will have i.e. it may now be possible to obtain a Certificate of Coverage when under the old bilateral agreement, this was not possible.\n\nContact us\nPlease feel free to reach out your local social security contact at Vialto Partners or to the Vialto Partners Social Security Leadership team:\n\nMartin Muhleder\nGlobal Social Security Partner\n\nGary Chandler\nUK/Ireland Social Security Director\n\nAlan McAllin\nGlobal Social Security Director\n\nAndrei Ioanei\nGlobal Social Security, Senior Manager\n\nLeanne Birch\nGlobal Social Security, Senior Manager\n\nLara Kodytek\nGlobal Social Security, Senior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit: www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nIreland | New employment permit act comes into force from 2 September 2024\n\nEffective from 2 September 2024, new provisions under the recently signed Employment Permits Act 2024 will be introduced. This is the biggest reform of Irish employment permit legislation in over 10 years and aims to provide a more flexible and modern system that is beneficial to both employers and employees alike.\n\nThe detail\n\nThe Act introduces a number of positive changes to the existing employment permits system including:\n\nChange of Employer – an individual can now seek to move employer after 9 months of working in Ireland on their first employment permit, down from the previous 12 month requirement. Such requests will be considered subject to certain eligibility criteria being met, including restricting the lateral movement to within the sector that the original permit was issued for. A change of employer submission will now also be accepted in lieu of filing a completely new employment permit application which is a welcome change.\n\nModernisation of the Labour Markets Needs Test for General Employment Permit and Contract for Services Employment Permit applications. While the position must continue to be advertised on the Jobs Ireland and EURES websites for 28 days, the outdated requirement to advertise the position in print media has finally been removed with this requirement moving to an online platform, for example a dedicated recruitment website or online newspaper. It’s important to note that the online advertisement must now be live for 28 days also, in line with the Jobs Ireland / EURES timelines, a departure from the previous 3 day requirement.\n\nInternal promotions and role progression with the current employer will be accommodated without the need to file a new application.\n\nRevision of the 50:50 criteria i.e. the requirement that at least 50% of employees of the Irish entity are EEA nationals, will be removed for the first employment permit application for a start-up operation. The 50:50 rule will instead be triggered when a second employment permit application is made.\n\nIntroduction of a Seasonal Employment Permit within certain sectors to address specific skills shortages for defined periods during the year. This will be introduced on a pilot basis from January 2025 and employers seeking to apply for Seasonal Employment Permits will need to be pre-registered as an approved seasonal employer on an annual basis.\n\nHow we can support\n\nWhile these changes to the employment permits system are without doubt progressive and welcome, they’re not without their challenges, particularly in terms of the short lead in time which leaves very little breathing space for employers to implement any changes that may be necessary in supporting upcoming employment permit applications. This is a significant change to current employment permit policy and one that may impact your existing employment, immigration and global mobility policies. We’re happy to discuss any queries you might have and assist you in navigating these changes.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAoife Kilmurray\nDirector\n\nLindsay Tester\nSenior Manager\n\nFergus English\nManager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nDue to UK Government delays to the eVisa rollout and concerns about accurate records, the Government’s Department for Home Affairs (Home Office) announced on 4 December 2024 that carriers (such as airlines, ferries and international rail) will be permitted to accept expired Biometric Residence Permits (BRPs) expiring on or after 31 December 2024 as valid evidence of permission to travel into the UK until at least 31 March 2025.\n\nThe detail\n\nAll BRPs are set to expire on 31 December 2024 and affected individuals have been urged to apply for eVisas in good time before this cut-off.   The Home Office has announced that it will allow carriers to accept a BRP expiring on or after 31 December 2024 as valid evidence of permission to travel until 31 March 2025, keeping this date under constant review.\n\nBRP holders, including those who already hold an eVisa, who are planning on travelling in the early part of 2025 are advised by the Home Office to continue carrying their expired BRP, in order to add to the range of checking options already available to airline carriers.  As a further precautionary measure, in case of any issues with their eVisas, those travelling in the early part of next year are also advised to carry a print-out of their online eVisa profile and a copy of their most recent application approval letter, where they still have this.\n\nActions for employers\n\nEmployers should continue to advise their employees who are BRP holders to apply for their eVisa as soon as possible, if they have not done so yet. In practice, issues with airlines accepting expired BRPs may be inevitable despite the new Home Office guidelines.  In line with the new Home Office guidance, alongside their expired BRP, employees should also carry a printed copy of their eVisa profile page and a copy of their most recent application approval (where they still have this).\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nLyudmyla Davies\nPartner (Solicitor)\n\nIan Robinson\nPartner\n\nAndrea Als\nDirector (Solicitor)\n\nTom Marsom\nDirector (Solicitor)\n\nLucy Vaux\nSenior Manager (Solicitor)\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nIreland | Introduction of Stamp 1G permission for spouses and partners of General Employment Permit and Intra-Company Transfer permit holders\n\nSummary\n\nEffective from 15 May 2024, eligible spouses and partners of General Employment Permit and Intra-Company Transfer permit holders will be granted Stamp 1G immigration permission. This will allow the holder to take up employment in Ireland without the need to hold a separate employment permit.\n\nThe detail\n\nSpouses and partners of General Employment Permit and Intra-Company Transfer permit holders who have been granted family reunification in accordance with current policy will now be granted Stamp 1G permission in place of existing Stamp 3 permission. This permission affords much more favourable employment rights to dependents in relation to labour market access as holders will now be permitted to work in Ireland without the need to hold a separate employment permit.\n\nFor couples and families relocating to Ireland this is a very welcome and long-called for move that recognises the importance of attracting key talent to Ireland. For employers, this widens the available talent pool and will facilitate the immediate filling of urgent skills gaps and much speedier employee onboarding.\n\nEligible dependents already registered in Ireland under Stamp 3 permission do not need to make an application to update their existing Irish Residence Permit (IRP) cards. The new 1G permission will be automatically afforded to such individuals with immediate effect and new IRP cards will only be issued at renewal stage.\n\nHow we can support\n\nWhile this is a progressive and most welcome announcement, we appreciate that this is also a significant change to current immigration and employment permit policy and one that may impact your current employment, immigration and global mobility policies. We are happy to discuss any queries you might have and assist you in navigating these changes.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAoife Kilmurray\nDirector\n\nLindsay Tester\nSenior Manager\n\nFergus English\nManager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&amp;R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Tax\n\nGermany | Berücksichtigung von überobligatorischen Beiträgen zu einer schweizerischen öffentlich-rechtlichen Pensionskasse\n\nZusammenfassung \nÜberobligatorische Beiträge zu einer schweizerischen öffentlich-rechtlichen Pensionskasse stellen in voller Höhe Arbeitslohn im Zeitpunkt der Beitragsleistung dar – so entschied der Bundesfinanzhof (BFH) am 12. Oktober 2023 (VI R 46/20; veröffentlicht am 15.02.2024). Die Beiträge sind nicht nach § 3 Nr. 56, Nr. 62 Satz 1 und Nr. 63 EStG steuerfrei.\n\nIm Detail \n§ 3 Nr. 56 EStG behandelt die Steuerbefreiung von Arbeitgeberbeiträgen zu einer nicht kapitalgedeckten, d.h. umlagefinanzierten betrieblichen Altersversorgung. Daher ist diese Vorschrift bei überobligatorischen Beiträgen zu einer Schweizer Pensionskasse nicht einschlägig.\n\nArbeitgeberbeiträge für die Zukunftssicherung des Arbeitnehmers sind nach § 3 Nr. 62 Satz 1 EStG steuerfrei, soweit für den Arbeitgeber eine sozialversicherungsrechtliche oder andere gesetzliche Verpflichtung besteht. Dies gilt auch, wenn die Verpflichtung auf ausländischen Gesetzen beruht. Bei den überobligatorischen Beiträgen mangelt es jedoch an einer gesetzlichen Verpflichtung sowie an der Vergleichbarkeit mit der deutschen Basisvorsorge.\n\nSomit könnte sich nur eine Steuerfreiheit nach § 3 Nr. 62 Satz 3 EStG ergeben. Hier sind jedoch in der Höchstbetragsberechnung bereits die obligatorisch geleisteten Zahlungen an die Pensionskasse sowie die Leistungen in die Alters- und Hinterlassenenversicherung (AHV) und Invalidenversicherung (IV) zu berücksichtigen. Daher ergeben sich in der Regel keine verbleibenden Abzugsmöglichkeiten für überobligatorische Beiträge.\n\nNach § 3 Nr. 63 EStG sind Arbeitgeberbeiträge an Pensionsfonds, Pensionskassen oder für eine Direktversicherung zum Aufbau einer kapitalgedeckten betrieblichen Altersversorgung steuerfrei, sofern bei der Auszahlung die Alters-, Invaliditäts- oder Hinterbliebenenversorgungleistung in Form einer Rente oder Auszahlungsplan vorgesehen ist und die Beiträge im Kalenderjahr 8% der Beitragsbemessungsgrenze der allgemeinen Rentenversicherung nicht übersteigen. Eine Steuerbefreiung für Beiträge an ausländische Pensionskassen greift auch, wenn diese mit einer inländischen Pensionskasse als Durchführungsweg der betrieblichen Altersversorgung nach dem deutschen Betriebsrentengesetz vergleichbar ist oder einem der Durchführungswege als vergleichbar zugeordnet werden kann. Die Vergleichbarkeit verneint der BFH, da die Auszahlung des Altersguthaben als Kapitalleistung vor Eintritt des Vorsorgefalles (bspw. bei Erwerb von Eigentum oder Verlassen der Schweiz) möglich ist, sodass eine Vergleichbarkeit zur deutschen Altersversorgung nicht gegeben sei.\n\nZukunftssicherungsleistungen des Arbeitgebers fließen dann zu, wenn der Arbeitgeber für den Arbeitnehmer Versicherungsbeiträge in der Weise leistet, dass ihm ein eigener unentziehbarer Anspruch auf Versicherungsleistungen entsteht. Unter dieser Prämisse sind dem Steuerpflichtigen die überobligatorischen Arbeitgeberbeiträge mit dem jeweiligen (monatlichen) Eingang auf dem Konto der Pensionskasse zugeflossen.\n\nFerner wird im Rahmen der Veranlagung auch kein Sonderausgabenabzug nach § 10 Abs. 1 Nr. 2 lit. a EStG gewährt, da keine Vergleichbarkeit mit der deutschen Basisversorgung, d.h. insbesondere der deutschen gesetzlichen Rentenversicherung, gegeben ist.\n\nObligatorische Arbeitgeberbeiträge sind hingegen nach § 3 Nr. 62 EStG in vollem Umfang steuerfrei, da die Zahlung des Arbeitgebers gesetzlich vorgeschrieben ist. Die inländische Beitragsbemessungsgrenze ist hier nicht zu beachten. Zudem wird in der Veranlagung der Sonderausgabenabzug gewährt.\n\nDie vom BFH vorgenommenen Prüfungsschritte können bei anderweitigen ausländischen Beiträge an Versorgungseinrichtungen analog angewandt werden.\n\nTax\n\nGermany | Consideration of above-mandatory contributions to a Swiss public-law pension fund\n\nSummary \nSo called above-mandatory contributions (Überobligatorium) to a Swiss public pension fund is seen as employment income at the time the contributions are made – as ruled by the Federal Fiscal Court (BFH) on October 12, 2023 (VI R 46/20; published on 15.02.2024). The contributions are not tax-free in accordance with Section 3 no. 56, no. 62 sentence 1 and no. 63 of the income tax act (EStG).\n\nThe detail \nSection 3 no. 56 EStG deals with the tax exemption of employer contributions to an unfunded, i.e. pay-as-you-go company pension scheme. This provision is therefore not relevant for above-mandatory contributions to a Swiss pension fund.\n\nEmployer contributions to secure the employee’s future are tax-free in accordance with Section 3 no. 62 sentence 1 EStG if the employer has a social security or other legal obligation. This also applies if the obligation is based on foreign laws. In the case of above-mandatory contributions, however, there is no legal obligation and no comparability with the German basic pension scheme.\n\nThis could only result in tax exemption in accordance with Section 3 no. 62 sentence 3 EStG. However, the mandatory payments made to the pension fund and the payments to the old-age and survivors’ insurance (AHV) and disability insurance (IV) must already be taken into account when calculating the maximum amount. Therefore, there are generally no remaining deduction options for above-mandatory contributions.\n\nAccording to Section 3 No. 63 EStG, employer contributions to pension funds or for direct insurance to build up a funded company pension scheme are tax-free, provided that the retirement, disability or survivors’ benefits are paid out in the form of a pension or payment plan and the contributions in the calendar year do not exceed 8% of the contribution assessment basis for general pension insurance. A tax exemption for contributions to foreign pension funds also apply if these are comparable to a domestic pension fund as an implementation channel of the company pension scheme in accordance with the German Company Pensions Act or can be classified as comparable to one of the implementation channels. The BFH denies comparability, as the retirement assets can be paid out as a lump sum before the insured event occurs (e.g. when acquiring property or leaving Switzerland), meaning that there is no comparability with German pension schemes.\n\nFuture pension benefits from the employer accrue when the employer makes insurance contributions on behalf of the employee in such a way that the employee is entitled to his or her own irrevocable claim to insurance benefits. Under this premise, the above-mandatory employer contributions accrue to the taxpayer upon the respective (monthly) receipt in the pension fund account.\n\nFurthermore, no special expense deduction is granted in accordance with Section 10 (1) no. 2 lit. a EStG, as there is no comparability with the German basic pension scheme, i.e. in particular the German statutory pension insurance.\n\nMandatory employer contributions, on the other hand, are fully tax-free in accordance with Section 3 no. 62 EStG, as the employer’s payment is required by law. The domestic contribution assessment ceiling does not apply here. In addition, the special expense deduction is granted.\n\nThe review steps carried out by the BFH can be applied analogously to other foreign contributions to pension schemes.\n\nContact us \nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMathias Schmitt \nPartner\n\nDamaris Besenreuther \nSenior Manager\n\nSina Kunzweiler \nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit: www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "February 20, 2024",
        "content": "Tax & Immigration\n\nJapan | Japan inheritance & gift tax and exit tax implications based on visa status in Japan\n\nSummary\nForeign nationals residing in Japan could have immediate or future exposure to Japan inheritance and gift tax and exit tax by holding a “Table 2” visa status in Japan.\n\nThe Detail\n\nInheritance or gifts\nJapan imposes taxes on individuals who receive assets through inheritance or gifts. For foreign nationals recipients, these assets can encompass not only those located in Japan but also extend to assets situated overseas (please note that the Japan inheritance and gift tax laws are different for Japanese national transferors/transferees; this alert does not address these laws for Japanese nationals and therefore, it does not cover all possible Japan inheritance/gift tax scenarios).\n\nFor certain foreign nationals, non-Japan situs assets may be excluded from taxable inheritance or gift (note: assets situated in Japan will always be subject to Japan inheritance/gift tax). While foreign national recipients of assets are subject to Japanese inheritance or gift tax, the scope of taxable assets depends not only on the recipients’ residency status in Japan but also the visa type (for foreign nationals) of the decedent/donors. Therefore, it is crucial to confirm the residence status, nationality, and visa type (for foreign nationals) for both the decedent/donors and heirs/donees.\n\nFor foreign national decedents/donors who are residents of Japan at the time of death/gift, non-Japan situs assets are not subject to Japanese inheritance/gift tax if:\n\nFor foreign national decedents/donors who are non-residents of Japan at the time of death/gift, non-Japan situs assets are not subject to Japanese inheritance/gift tax if:\n\nIf the mentioned exemptions do not apply, recipients of assets would be subject to Japanese inheritance/gift tax on both Japan and non-Japan situs assets.\n\nTax rates for both Japanese inheritance tax and gift tax can reach as high as 55%, although the pace at which higher tax brackets are reached differs.\n\nIn summary, foreign nationals considering converting from a Table 1 visa to a Table 2 visa (such as a permanent resident visa) should be aware that there will be immediate or increased exposure to Japan gift and inheritance tax, both for the foreign national converting to the Table 2 visa as well as for foreign nationals receiving assets from the foreign national converting to the Table 2 visa. This is because the exemption in place for foreign nationals residing in Japan on a Table 1 visa (as is usually the case for foreign nationals on work assignments in Japan) for no more than 10 years out of the last 15 years would no longer apply.\n\nJapanese Exit Tax Implications\nIn an effort to prevent wealthy individuals from possibly escaping tax on unrealized capital gains. foreign nationals residing in Japan who satisfy both of the following conditions are subject to Japan exit tax upon exit from Japan:\n\nThe Japanese ‘exit tax’ is a national tax on deemed capital gains (tax rate is the flat 15.315%), as if the individual sold all applicable financial assets (mainly securities such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds) upon leaving Japan. This deemed capital gains tax rule in Japan has been effective since July 1, 2020 for foreign nationals.\n\nMoreover, ‘exit tax’ applies to transferring such financial assets from Japan residents (who meet the conditions mentioned above) to non-residents even if the Japan residents do not permanently leave Japan (for instance, transfer through gift or inheritance). Therefore, on a gift/inheritance, both the exit tax and gift/inheritance tax could apply.\n\nIt is important to check the visa status of an individual who is permanently leaving Japan since the visa status impacts the applicability of the Japanese exit tax.\n\nWhat this means\nWhen an individual is eligible for both Table 1 visa and Table 2 visa and is making a decision on which visa type one prefers to hold, it is recommended to take into consideration the impact on tax in addition to the impact caused by the Immigration laws of Japan.\n\nThe table below shows the visa types under Table 1 and Table 2 of the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act of Japan.\n\nIndividuals should be aware that the type of visa, nationality, and number of years of having jusho in Japan have significant importance with respect to Japan gift and inheritance tax.\n\nIn addition, long-term foreign residents in Japan who have significant financial assets and are subject to the exit tax because of their visa type, should certainly consider the affect to their situation when planning their overseas relocation or the transfer of assets to non-residents of Japan.\n\nThe tax laws surrounding Japan gift and inheritance tax as well as exit tax are complex, so we highly recommend individuals to seek professional advice when considering changes to their visa status.\n\nLastly, we also highly recommend companies to review their policies to determine whether inheritance and gift tax as well as exit tax is within the scope of their policy coverage, and if so, how to apply the tax settlement.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMarcus Wong,\nPartner\n\nNoriyuki Tominaga\nPartner\n\nRyo Uehara\nJapan, Director\n\nJia Ee\nJapan, Director\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nContact us on the following address – me-immigration@vialto.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Germany | Selective possibilities for amendment of a tax assessment in accordance with the German Income Tax Act",
        "date": "December 4, 2024",
        "content": "Global Mobility Tax\n\nSummary\n\nIn its ruling of August 1, 2024 (case reference VI R 34/21), the Federal Fiscal Court (BFH) clarified that a change to a final tax assessment in accordance with § 50d (8) sentence 2 of the German Income Tax Act (EStG) is only possible if the income of an employee who is a fully liable taxpayer has been included in the relevant income tax assessment in violation of the agreement due to a lack of evidence (proof of taxation) in accordance with § 50d, paragraph 8, sentence 1 of the EStG.\n\nThe detail\n\nIn the case at hand, the claimant, a British citizen residing in Germany, had worked as a soldier for the British armed forces until January 2014 and had received both regular pay and a severance payment. In his income tax return, the severance payment was treated as taxable salary because it was assumed that Germany was entitled to tax the payment under the subject-to-tax clause of Article 23, para. 1, letter a) of the Germany/United Kingdom Double Taxation Agreement since the severance payment was not taxable in the United Kingdom.\n\nSubsequently, the British tax authority HM Revenue &amp; Customs confirmed that the severance payment was not taxable under British tax law. With reference to the Federal Ministry of Finance circular dated June 20, 2013, BStBl. I 2013, 980, No. 2.3, the plaintiff stated that the conditions of the subject-to-tax clause of the DBA were not met and requested an amendment to the tax assessment notice in accordance with § 50d (8) sentence 2 Income Tax Act. The severance payment would be tax-exempt in Germany.\n\nThe Federal Fiscal Court ruled that an amendment to the tax assessment notice under § 50d, para. 8, sentence 2 Income Tax Act is only permissible if the taxation in contravention of the agreement is directly attributable to the missing evidence under § 50d, para. 8, sentence 1 Income Tax Act. In the case at hand, however, the severance payment had been taxed due to an incorrect application of the Double Tax Agreement and not because of missing evidence. Therefore, an amendment of the tax assessment notice under § 50d, para. 8, sentence 2 Income Tax Act was not justified.\n\nThe Federal Fiscal Court states that, according to the wording, the amendment under Section 50d, para. 8, sentence 2 Income Tax Act is a selective amendment if the proof under Section 50d, para. 8, sentence 1 income tax act is only provided retrospectively. The intention of the law confirms the interpretation of the wording.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that if an amending regulation under the Fiscal Code applies, it is still possible to amend the notice.

VI R 34/21) klargestellt, dass eine Änderung eines bestandskräftigen Steuerbescheids gemäß § 50d Abs. 8 Satz 2 des Einkommensteuergesetzes (EStG) nur dann möglich ist, wenn Arbeitnehmereinkünfte eines unbeschränkt Steuerpflichtigen aufgrund fehlender Nachweise gemäß § 50d Abs. 8 Satz 1 EStG abkommenswidrig in die betreffende Einkommensteuerveranlagung einbezogen wurden.\n\nIm vorliegenden Fall hatte der Kläger, ein britischer Staatsbürger mit Wohnsitz in Deutschland, bis Januar 2014 als Soldat für die britischen Streitkräfte gearbeitet und dafür sowohl laufenden Arbeitslohn als auch eine Abfindung erhalten. In seiner Einkommensteuererklärung wurde die Abfindungszahlung als steuerpflichtiger Arbeitslohn berücksichtigt, da davon ausgegangen wurde, dass das Besteuerungsrecht nach der subject-to- tax-Klausel des Art. 23 Abs. 1 Buchstabe a) DBA Deutschland/Großbritannien Deutschland zusteht, da die Abfindung nicht in Großbritannien steuerpflichtig ist.\n\nIm Nachgang bescheinigte die britische Steuerbehörde HM Revenue &amp; Customs, dass die Abfindung nach britischem Steuerrecht nicht steuerpflichtig sei. Mit Hinweis auf das BMF-Schreiben vom 20.06.2013, BStBl. I 2013, 980, Tz. 2.3 erklärt der Kläger, dass die Voraussetzungen der Subject-to-tax-clausel des DBA nicht erfüllt wäre und begehrt eine Änderung des Steuerbescheides nach § 50d Abs. 8 S. 2 EStG. Die Abfindung wäre in Deutschland steuerfrei zu stellen.\n\nDer BFH entschied, dass eine Änderung des Steuerbescheids nach § 50d Abs. 8 Satz 2 EStG nur zulässig ist, wenn die abkommenswidrige Besteuerung direkt auf die fehlenden Nachweise gemäß § 50d Abs. 8 Satz 1 EStG zurückzuführen ist. Im vorliegenden Fall war die Abfindung jedoch aufgrund einer fehlerhaften Anwendung des DBA und nicht wegen fehlender Nachweise besteuert worden. Daher war eine Änderung des\nSteuerbescheids nach § 50d Abs. 8 Satz 2 EStG nicht gerechtfertigt. Der BFH führt aus, dass es sich bei der Änderung nach § 50d Abs. 8 S. 2 EStG, dem Wortlaut nach, um eine punktuelle Änderungsnorm handelt, soweit der Nachweis nach § 50d Abs. 8 S. 1 EStG erst im Nachhinein geführt wird. Die Gesetzessystematik bestätigt die Wortlautauslegung.\n\nZu beachten ist jedoch, dass sofern eine Änderungsnorm nach der Abgabenordnung Anwendung findet, eine Änderung des Bescheides weiterhin möglich ist. Nach § 175 Abs. 1 S. 1 Nr. 2 AO sind Steuerbescheide zu ändern, sofern ein Ereignis eingetreten ist, das steuerliche Wirkung für die Vergangenheit hat. Dies könnte beispielsweise vorliegen, wenn nachträglich eine Betriebsstätte im Ausland festgestellt wurde, die die Vergütung trägt.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMathias Schmitt\nPartner\n\nSina Kunzweiler\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "December 21, 2023\n\nUnited States | Employment Tax | New York state ‘convenience of the employer’ ruling\n\nImpact High\n\nSummary\n\nNew York state has upheld its long-standing convenience of the employer rule  even during 2020 when employers required employees to work from home under state government shut down orders.\n\nOverview\n\nNew York’s Division of Tax Appeals (ALJ) recently posted a determination in the Matter of Zelinsky (Nos. 830517 and 830681). This case is the Taxpayer’s second attempt to make an argument against New York’s “convenience of the employer test.” The facts presented by the taxpayer are as follows:\n\n• 2019: Taxpayer filed an amended NYS nonresident return to reduce their nonresident income allocation from 55.41% to 20.50%, allocating income from NYS to their home state of Connecticut. Taxpayer reported that he worked from his home in Connecticut a total of 84 days performing legal scholarship (researching and writing) and performing administrative tasks. These facts of petitioner’s work situation in tax year 2019 are the same as they were in tax years 1994 and 1995, which were at issue in the Zelinsky v Tax Appeals Trib., 1 NY3d 85 (2003), cert denied 541 US 1009 (2004) decision.\n• 2020: From January 21, 2020 to March 15, 2020, Taxpayer taught his classes in person at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law of Yeshiva University in Manhattan (Cardozo), beginning on March 16, 2020 to December 31, 2020, Taxpayer worked exclusively at his home in Connecticut and never physically went into New York to work in compliance with NYS governor COVID-related executive orders. Taxpayer filed an amended NYS nonresident return to reduce their nonresident income allocation from 73.27% to 7.03%.\n\nThe ALJ determined that for 2019, the facts in the case were the same as the facts in Taxpayer’s prior case and as such ruled that the prior ruling was binding – denying refund claimed. The ALJ provided that the Taxpayer failed to carry his burden of proof to show that the Division of Taxation’s allocation of all of his income from his employment with Cardozo to New York in 2019 violated the Due Process and dormant Commerce Clauses.\n\nFor 2020, and specifically for the period of March 15, 2020, through December 31, 2020, the ALJ determined that the Taxpayer did not meet his burden of proof to show that working from home was for his employer’s necessity and not his convenience. Below are some of the ALJ determinations:\n\n• The ALJ provides that the case is an issue of first impression, a new legal issue or interpretation given that the pandemic was unprecedented. Although Taxpayers New York office was not available due to the pandemic, it did not result in the determination that the out-of-state services were performed for the employer’s necessity. Taxpayer offered no support that his New York employer required him to perform any work in Connecticut or any other state than New York.\n• The work performed at home by Taxpayer was not found to be so specialized that it had to be done away from New York by the necessity his employer. Additionally, “The Executive Order mandating that all employees work from home due to a worldwide pandemic cannot result in special tax benefits to those who do not live in New York, but nonetheless work for, and benefit from, a New York employer.”\n• The argument that during March 15, 2020 – December 31, 2020, the Taxpayer worked “wholly without New York State” and therefore should not be subject to the convenience of the employer rule was also ruled against since it directly contradicts the convenience rule. The Taxpayer worked in NYS partially during the year and continued to work in his position in the same capacity for a New York employer. The ALJ further provided that petitioner “remotely connected to Cardozo and had a virtual presence in New York when hosting Zoom classes and meetings with his students. In this modern economy with its internet technology, one can be present in a state without needing to physically be there.”\n• The ALJ also ruled that neither the Due Process nor dormant Commerce Clauses were violated in the allocation of income as determined by the Division of Tax. Taxpayer performed duties for and received an income from Cardozo, which constitutes New York source income. Taxpayer was also able to earn a New York salary and receive “tangible and intangible protections, benefits, and values connected with New York” by virtue of performing his duties virtually.\n\nHow we can help\n\nVialto can assist with New York state convenience of the employer issues, documenting remote/hybrid work positions and determining risk factors with such remote work arrangements. In light of the current New York state audit environment, Vialto can assist in reviewing the current state and local employment tax setup of employees in the payroll system specifically for New York, help to draft policies on state and local withholding tax requirements for remote workers and/or short-term business travelers, and provide support with employment tax notices or audits.\n\nPlease reach out directly to your Vialto contact or one of the individuals listed below to discuss next steps.\n\nContact us\n\nPlease reach out to us to discuss further.\n\nTina Schrob\n+1 (201) 787-0114\ncristina.g.schrob@vialto.com\n\nGreg Fetter\n+1 (908) 313-6439\ngregory.fetter@vialto.com\n\nJessica Castro-Acevedo\n+1 (347) 204-8729\njessica.j.castro.acevedo@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com",

        "title": "United Kingdom | Global Mobility Tax | Changes to the UK taxation of non-domiciled and inbound individuals from 6 April 2025",
        "date": "July 31, 2024",
        "content": "Global Mobility Tax\n\nUnited Kingdom | Changes to the UK taxation of non-domiciled and inbound individuals from 6 April 2025\n\nSummary\n\nThe Labour government has confirmed major changes to the UK taxation of foreign income and gains (“FIG”) from 6 April 2025 for people coming to the UK who have not been tax resident in the UK in any of the previous 10 tax years.  The policy was originally announced by the previous government in March 2024.\n\nThe key features of the new FIG regime, as previously announced, have been retained, but some of the temporary and grandfathering concessions to ease the transition to the new regime have been scrapped.  Consultations on how the new regime should operate have largely been scrapped but there are exceptions on a few specific points where the government wants to engage with stakeholders. The new government will now develop legislation for the next Finance Bill, and we might see some more detail in the new Chancellor’s first Budget, which will be on 30 October 2024.\n\nA new tax regime for inheritance tax, based on whether a person had been a tax resident in the UK for at least 10 years, will also be introduced from 6 April 2025, replacing the existing regime based on domicile.  The government is working out the precise details of the new regime.\n\nBrief recap: The current regime\n\nCurrently, individuals who are not UK domiciled can choose to be taxed in the UK on the remittance basis.  This allows them to be taxed only on UK-sourced investment income and gains providing their non-UK income and gains are paid and kept offshore (i.e. the offshore income and gains are only taxable if remitted to the UK).  The remittance basis of taxation is an annual election which is available for up to the first 15 years of tax residence.  Overseas workday relief is also available for non-UK domiciled individuals claiming the remittance basis for the first 3 years of tax residence.\n\nNew 4 year residence based regime for foreign income and gains (“FIG”)\n\nThe new government has confirmed the abolition of the remittance basis of taxation for income and gains arising after 5 April 2025.\n\nInstead, a new 4-year Foreign Income and Gains (“FIG”) regime will be introduced based purely on residence status.\n\nThe new regime will only apply to individuals who become a UK tax resident after having been non-resident for 10 consecutive tax years immediately before coming to the UK.\n\nMeeting this test will allow individuals an annual choice as to how they are taxed in the UK for only the first four tax years of tax residence: the arising basis of tax (taxed on worldwide income and gains) or the FIG regime (taxed only on UK source income and gains).\n\nThere will no longer be a requirement to keep FIG that arises after 5 April 2025 offshore in order to benefit from relief from UK taxes.  However, any foreign income and gains that arose before that date, and was (not) taxed under the old remittance basis regime would continue to be taxed if remitted to the UK after 5 April 2025 (tax rate to be determined by transitional arrangements mentioned below to encourage investment in the UK).  The new FIG regime only applies to income and gains that arise after 5 April 2025.\n\nOverseas workday relief\n\nIn a possible change to the previous proposals, the government has announced that while some form of overseas workday relief will be retained, it will engage with stakeholders to review the design principles of this tax relief.  Further details will be confirmed in the Budget.\n\nVialto View\n\nA review of the design principles for overseas workday relief is a very welcome announcement.  Expatriate tax regimes are often a key consideration for workers and employers in choosing a location base for international moves.  The current regime of overseas workday relief is complicated and ultimately encourages individuals to work outside the UK.\n\nIt will be interesting to understand the eligibility for the new regime; in particular will it be available for returning UK domiciled individuals who have been non-resident for the previous 10 years?\n\nTransitional arrangements\n\nThe previous government had indicated 3 key transitional arrangements.\n\nThe first was that only 50% of foreign income would be taxed in 2025/26 for individuals losing access to the remittance basis.  The new government has confirmed that there will be no transition.  Therefore 100% of foreign income and gains will be taxed from 2025/26 for those resident in the UK and not eligible for the new FIG regime.\n\nThe second transitional arrangement was for current and former remittance basis users to be able to rebase foreign assets to 5 April 2019.  The government has confirmed that rebasing will be allowed but is considering the appropriate rebasing date.\n\nThe final transitional arrangement was to introduce a Temporary Repatriation Facility (“TRF”) to encourage individuals to remit pre-6 April 2025 FIG at a reduced rate of 12% for two years.  The government has said it will keep the TRF, but will review the reduced tax rate to be offered and the proposed length of time for the concessional rate, to make the TRF as attractive as possible and encourage people to bring money and investments swiftly into the UK.  The government is also considering expanding TRF to include stockpiled income and gains within overseas structures.\n\nTrusts\n\nFrom 6 April 2025, deemed UK domiciled and non-UK domiciled individuals who do not qualify for the 4 year FIG regime will lose tax protection on income and gains within settlor-interested tax structures.\n\nThe government has also indicated that they will review offshore anti avoidance legislation (including Transfer of Assets Abroad and Settlements legislation) to modernise the rules and ensure effectiveness.  Details of the review will follow but the Government has indicated that it does not expect this review to result in any changes before the 2026/27 UK tax year.\n\nInheritance tax\n\nCurrently, people who are not domiciled in the UK, and not deemed domiciled, only pay UK inheritance tax (“IHT”) on UK situs assets, i.e. assets located in the UK.  UK domiciled or deemed domiciled people (i.e. people who have been tax resident for at least 15 of the previous 20 UK tax years) are subject to IHT on worldwide assets.\n\nThe government has announced that the current rules will be replaced from 6 April 2025.  The basic test for whether non-UK assets are in scope for IHT from 6 April 2025 will be whether a person has been resident in the UK for 10 years prior to the tax year in which the chargeable event (including death) arises, with provision to keep a person in scope for 10 years after leaving the UK.  The government will “engage with stakeholders” on how this test should operate, but there will not be any formal consultation about the policy decision to move to a residence-based test for IHT from April 2025.\n\nMany non-domiciled individuals, particularly those who have become deemed domiciled, have used non-UK trusts set up before becoming deemed domiciled to hold non-UK assets. If correctly structured, these trusts could exclude the offshore assets from IHT even after the person had become deemed domiciled.  The government will end the IHT exemption of these Excluded Property Trusts, but is considering how to introduce this change to allow for appropriate adjustments to existing trust arrangements, while ensuring that all long-term residents of the UK have the same IHT treatment of their worldwide assets.  More detailed information is expected in the Budget.\n\nVialto View\n\nOn the face of it, replacing the subjective non-domicile IHT regime with an ostensibly more objective IHT regime based on the UK’s statutory residence test ought to be a simplification.  However, the new IHT regime will be more complicated than it looks.\n\nThe design of the 10-years of residence test for IHT is important.  Will it be measured over the previous 10 years or on a rolling basis of any 10 years in the past (say) 20 years?\n\nGiven the current rules about becoming deemed domiciled in the UK after 15 years of residence, a new 10-year rule arguably simply brings forward the existing trigger date for worldwide IHT.  However the decision to pierce the current protection from IHT offered by offshore Excluded Property Trusts will seriously affect a number of wealthier non-doms who have remained in the UK for at least 10 years.\n\nFor global mobility teams, it is not just employees who could be affected.  The spouse of an employee might have had a different residence pattern over the previous 10 or 20 years, and could fall into or out of the new IHT regime at different times from the employee. To date, tax equalisation policies have rarely needed to consider IHT because non-domicile status held good, but under a new resident test this could change in the future.\n\nRecommended actions\n\nWhat’s coming up\n\nEngagement sessions\n\nWe await news from the Government of the timing for engagement sessions on OWR and IHT.\n\nAutumn Budget\n\nThe government has announced the Autumn Budget will be held on 30th October 2024.  Further tax changes are expected as the Chancellor has warned of “difficult choices”.\n\nIn addition, the Government has already announced changes in two further areas which may be of interest to employers:\n\nVAT on private school fees\n\nThe government also confirmed two widely expected tax changes that will increase the cost of private school fees.\n\nThese changes will affect outbound assignees who use UK boarding schools to maintain a UK education, and inbound assignees who use international schools in the UK to maintain the local curriculum for the children accompanying assignees on a UK secondment, e.g. French or Japanese schools.  Where the employer pays for the cost of a child’s school fees, this could increase the cost of the benefit on a grossed-up basis.\n\nAlthough VAT at 20% will be charged on school fees, including boarding fees, the actual fees might rise by less than this.  The schools will now be able to reclaim input VAT charged on bills the school pays to its suppliers and, allowing for this, the government expects schools to be liable for VAT amounting to around 15% of their fee income.\n\nCarried interest\n\nThe government has also issued a call for evidence about its proposals to change the way carried interest is taxed. Submissions should be provided by 30 August 2024 and a further announcement is expected at the Budget on 30 October. Carried interest is a form of performance-related reward received by fund managers, primarily within the private equity industry.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "December 5, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nEffective December 2, 2024, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will require Form I-693, Report of Immigration Medical Examination and Vaccination Record to be included with Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. USCIS has revised the Form I-485 instructions accordingly to make filing the two forms together a requirement.\n\nThe detail\n\nIn the past, Adjustment of Status applicants could choose to submit the I-693 medical exam with their initial Adjustment of Status applications or at a later time when requested by USCIS, while the application was already filed and pending with USCIS. On December 2, 2024, USCIS announced that they are aiming to reduce the case processing backlog by requiring the medical exam with initial Adjustment of Status filings. With this new requirement, there should be fewer requests for evidence and thus quicker overall processing times for Form I-485.\n\nUSCIS announced this change without giving any grace period. Therefore, any submitted Adjustment of Status applications that were not received by USCIS as of December 2, 2024 will likely be rejected. Therefore, applicants are encouraged to complete the medical exam and resubmit their applications as soon as possible to avoid any issues or gaps with their immigration status. For those applicants that are filing their Adjustment of Status application on or after December 2, 2024, they will now need to ensure a medical exam is completed and included with the filing.\n\nWhat this means\n\nUnder the new USCIS requirements, applicants can no longer wait to submit their I-693 medical exam after the Form I-485 has been filed. Therefore, when preparing a Form I-485 application, applicants should plan ahead with their designated physician to complete the I-693 medical exam and have it ready to file along with the Form I-485.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nManish Daftari\nPartner\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nAs part of Qatar’s Nationalisation Law (‘The Law’) in the private sector, the Government has announced plans to target eight strategic sectors. We reported on the introduction of The Law in September 2024, which is expected to take effect in March 2025.\n\nThe detail\n\nDuring a panel discussion the Chairman of the Qatar Chamber announced that nationalisation initiatives aim to focus on the following eight strategic sectors:\n\nEach sector will be overseen by dedicated sectoral Councils with a purpose to facilitate continuous communication, enhance dialogue, promote effective partnerships and align sectoral strategies between senior Ministry of Labour officials and private sector organisations.\n\nThe Law will be implemented in three phases. The phased implementation of this strategy will allow businesses to gradually adapt to the nationalisation objectives, beginning with a foundational stage centred on skill development through tailored trained programmes for each sector. The first phase will be followed by a capacity-building phase that emphasises the employment of Qatar nationals, and the final phase will drive a comprehensive transformation, ensuring a sustainable and long-term shift in the workforce.\n\nThe Ministry of Labour also introduced a six-year strategy aimed at enhancing nationalisation within the private sector, while also raising the share of skilled foreign nationals in the workforce.\n\nThe new strategy features aims to:\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe Law aims to primarily support the private sector rather than create obstacles for companies and institutions. The implementation of The Law in three phases signals the Government’s recognition of the crucial role of the private sector in building the local workforce and aims to help the private sector adjust to The Law.\n\nThe strategy aligns with Qatar National Vision 2030 , particularly the nationalisation of jobs and the increase of proportion of highly skilled workers in the private sector.\n\nIt is important for privately owned companies to comply with the new strategy once in effect, and the requirements that need to be satisfied in order to comply with The Law.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe expect the government to announce further details in the near future.

        "title": "Germany | Tax | Neuerungen bei der Besteuerung von Arbeitnehmereinkünften nach dem DBA Luxemburg",
        "date": "April 2, 2024",
        "content": "Tax\n\nGermany | Neuerungen bei der Besteuerung von Arbeitnehmereinkünften nach dem DBA Luxemburg\n\nZusammenfassung \nAuch nach Ende der Corona-Pandemie arbeiten viele Arbeitnehmer:innen weiterhin aus dem Home-Office. Bei grenzüberschreitenden Fällen führt dies oftmals dazu, dass die Steuerpflichtigen hierdurch mit Arbeitstagen im Heimatland / Ansässigkeitsstaat steuerpflichtig werden und eine Aufteilung des Arbeitslohns zwischen den Ländern notwendig wird, damit eine Doppelbesteuerung vermieden wird.\n\nIm Detail \nIm Vergleich zu anderen Ländern hat Deutschland mit Luxemburg keine Grenzgängerregelung, sodass grundsätzlich der Arbeitslohn aufzuteilen ist.\n\nMit BMF-Schreiben vom 15.01.2024 wurde nun die zwischen beiden Vertragsstaaten abgeschlossene Konsultationsvereinbarung vom 11.01.2024 zur einheitlichen Anwendung und Auslegung des DBA-Luxemburg in der Fassung des Änderungsprotokolls vom 06.07.2023 veröffentlicht.\n\nDas geänderte DBA sieht nun eine erhöhte Bagatellregelung vor. Demnach wird von einer Besteuerung im Ansässigkeitsstaat abgesehen, wenn der grenzüberschreitend Beschäftigte seine Tätigkeit im Ansässigkeitsstaat an nicht mehr als 34 Tagen pro Kalenderjahr ausübt.\n\nWird die Bagatellgrenze überschritten und ist eine Aufteilung vorzunehmen, so wird gemäß der neuen Konsultationsvereinbarung vom 11.1.2024 nunmehr die tatsächlich ausgeübte Arbeitszeit herangezogen und die Aufteilung erfolgt grundsätzlich minutengenau. Eine minutengenaue Aufteilung ist jedoch dann nicht vorzunehmen, wenn die Tätigkeit im anderen Staat weniger als 30 Minuten beträgt.\n\nFerner enthält die Konsultationsvereinbarung Regelungen zur Zuteilung des Besteuerungsrechts bei Arbeitsfreistellung. Nach rein nationalem Recht wird in Deutschland unterschieden, ob es sich um eine widerrufliche oder unwiderrufliche Arbeitsfreistellung handelt. Bei einer widerruflichen Arbeitsfreistellung muss es nicht zu einer Arbeitsleistung kommen, aber der Arbeitnehmer muss sich grundsätzlich zur Verfügung halten. Daher ist aus nationaler Sicht für die Zuordnung des Besteuerungsrechts entscheidend, in welchem Land sich der Arbeitnehmer zur Verfügung hält. Bei der unwiderruflichen Freistellung findet keine Arbeitsleistung mehr statt, sodass nach nationaler Sicht dem Ansässigkeitsstaat das Besteuerungsrecht zusteht.\n\nGemäß den neuen Regelungen im Verhältnis zu Luxemburg gilt die Zahlung für die widerrufliche und die unwiderrufliche Freistellung jedoch als für die Ausübung einer Tätigkeit in demjenigen Vertragsstaat gewährt, in dem die Tätigkeit ohne die Freistellung ausgeübt worden wäre. Folglich ist eine Prognose zu erstellen, die auf Umstände und Verhältnisse in der Vergangenheit zurückgreift. Sofern die Freistellung in der zweiten Jahreshälfte beginnt, ist für die Prognose auf die erste Jahreshälfte abzustellen. Erfolgt die Freistellung in der ersten Jahreshälfte, ist für die Prognose auf die Verhältnisse des Vorjahres abzustellen.\n\nTax\n\nGermany | Changes to the taxation of employee income under the Luxembourg DTA\n\nSummary \nEven after the end of the coronavirus pandemic, many employees continue to work from home. In cross-border cases, this often means that taxpayers become liable for tax on working days in their home country / country of residence and it becomes necessary to split wages between the countries in order to avoid double taxation.\n\nIn Detail \nCompared to other countries, Germany does not have a cross-border commuter regulation with Luxembourg, which means that wages must always be apportioned.\n\nWith the BMF letter dated 15.01.2024, the consultation agreement concluded between the two contracting states on 11.01.2024 on the uniform application and interpretation of the DTA-Luxembourg in the version of the protocol of amendment dated 06.07.2023 has now been published.\n\nThe amended DTA now provides for an increased de minimis rule. Accordingly, taxation in the country of residence is waived if the cross-border employee does not work in the country of residence for more than 34 days per calendar year.\n\nIf the de minimis limit is exceeded and a split is to be made, the new consultation agreement of 11.1.2024 now stipulates that the actual working time performed is used and the split is generally made to the minute. However, a minute-by-minute allocation is not to be made if the activity in the other country is less than 30 minutes.\n\nThe consultation agreement also contains provisions on the allocation of the right of taxation in the event of a work exemption. Under purely national law, a distinction is made in Germany between revocable and irrevocable leaves of absence. In the case of a revocable leave of absence, no work has to be performed, but the employee must in principle remain available. Therefore, from a national perspective, the country in which the employee is available is decisive for the allocation of the right to tax. In the case of irrevocable leave of absence, there is no longer any work performed, meaning that from a national perspective, the country of residence has the right of taxation.\n\nHowever, according to the new regulations in relation to Luxembourg, the payment for the revocable and irrevocable exemption is deemed to have been granted for the exercise of an activity in the contracting state in which the activity would have been exercised without the exemption. Consequently, a forecast must be made based on circumstances and conditions in the past. If the exemption begins in the second half of the year, the forecast must be based on the first half of the year. If the leave of absence takes place in the first half of the year, the forecast must be based on the circumstances of the previous year.\n\nContact us \nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMathias Schmitt \nPartner\n\nDamaris Besenreuther \nSenior Manager\n\nSina Kunzweiler \nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit: www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "United States | Immigration | USCIS to Resume Adjudicating I-539 / I-765 Applications With I-129 Petitions",
        "date": "January 24, 2023",
        "content": "January 23, 2023\n\nImpact: Medium\n\nSummary\n\nStarting January 25, 2023, USCIS will adjudicate Form I-539 and Form I-765 applications for H-4 and L-2 derivatives at the same time as the underlying I-129 petition for the main H-1B and L-1 applicant, when the forms are filed together.\n\nThe Detail\n\nPrior to March 2019, USCIS would generally adjudicate Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, and Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization at the same time as the I-129 petition when the forms were filed together. However, in 2019, USCIS changed a number of its policies, including requiring H-4 and L-2 derivatives to provide biometrics before adjudicating their application. As a result, Form I-539 applications, filed on behalf of H-4 and L-2 derivatives, were separated from I-129 petitions and adjudicated separately.  Accordingly, the wait times for I-539 applications grew longer, with some applications taking over a year to process. Due to the long wait times, some H-4 and L-2 holders had to stop working as their Employment Authorization Document (EAD) expired while their current extensions continued to remain pending with USCIS.\n\nIn order to redress this situation, two class action lawsuits were filed in 2021 seeking relief for spouses of H-1B and L-1 status holders. USCIS ultimately settled both lawsuits. In November 2021, USCIS issued policy guidance that granted automatic extensions of employment for certain H-4, E and L nonimmigrant spouses. On January 19, 2023, a second settlement was reached where USCIS agreed to bundle adjudications of I-539 and I-765 applications for H-4 and L-2 derivatives when filed with the I-129 petition.\n\nRegardless of whether the primary H-1B or L-1 petition is filed under regular or premium processing, USCIS will now issue a decision on the Form I-539 and the Form I-765 application at the same time as a decision is rendered on the I-129 petition.  This settlement is effective on January 25, 2023 and is valid for two years.\n\nWhat this means\n\nAs a result of this settlement, processing times for derivative applications should be significantly reduced.  This will help mitigate potential gaps in employment for spouses. Additionally, issues with ancillary benefits, such as obtaining a renewed driver’s license based on a pending application, should be reduced as the derivative will now have an approved application.\n\nContact us\n\nPlease reach out to Manish Daftari (manish.daftari@vialto.com) to discuss further.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Belgium | Employment Tax | Personal income tax reflections",
        "date": "August 13, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nBelgium | Personal income tax reflections\n\nSummary\n\nWith the first deadlines for the filing of Belgian resident tax returns in relation to income year 2023 (notably 30 June 2024 ‘for paper filing’ and 19 July 2024 ‘for electronic filing of non-complex tax returns’) now behind us, the time seems right to reflect on this and to prepare for the next upcoming tax return deadline of 16 October 2024 for ‘complex’ tax returns. Furthermore, in the light of the 2024 government formation we are looking ahead to some of the proposed (federal) tax measures, which may ultimately come into effect in 2025.\n\nDeadlines Belgian resident tax returns\n\nWith respect to the resident tax returns related to income year 2023, assessment year 2024, the following\ndeadlines are applicable:\n\n● Paper filing: 30 June 2024\n● Online filing (Tax-On-Web):\n\nBelgian resident taxpayers – which deadline?\n\nThe final deadline (October 16, 2024) applies for taxpayers in any of the following situations:\n\n● The taxpayer has self-employed income (e.g. profits and/or gains, company director income) or foreign professional income which is fully or partially exempted from taxation in Belgium;\n\n● The taxpayer declares for the first time this year:\n\n● The taxpayer declared a legal construction (Cayman tax) last year.\n\nThe tax return must be filed online (via Tax-On-Web) in order to benefit from the extended deadline of October 16. If the return is submitted by post, the deadline is 30 June 2024. In case of a proposal for a simplified tax declaration (these cases are increasing), the taxpayer had to notify the Belgian tax authorities in advance to be able to benefit from the extended deadline for ‘complex’ tax returns.\n\nThe Belgian resident tax return: not a walk in the park\n\nThe Belgian resident tax return can be a complex exercise for many taxpayers, especially for those who are new to the Belgian tax system and/or those who receive income from abroad / hold foreign assets. For example, resident taxpayers have additional mandatory reporting obligations (outside of their individual tax return) if they hold foreign accounts or if they own foreign real estate. These specific obligations are intended to ensure transparency and accurate tax assessment (on the taxpayer’s worldwide income) for all income and assets, regardless of where these are situated.\n\nFurthermore, even for those familiar with the Belgian tax system, the filing of the tax return can be quite a challenge. As of income year 2023, there are two cases whereby taxpayers are required to attach a new annex to their tax return.\n\n● Annex 270 MLH regarding the deductibility of rent paid as actual professional expense\n● Annex 276 CJC regarding legal constructions\n\nTaxpayers in these situations often require professional assistance to ensure compliance with all legal reporting obligations. Fortunately, the extended deadline provides some additional time to gather and accurately report all necessary information, reducing the risk of errors and penalties.\n\nPlease reach out to Vialto Partners in case you require assistance with the Belgian resident tax return.\n\nTax reform 2025?\n\nMr Bart De Wever, leader of the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and in charge of the formation of a new federal government in Belgium, has proposed various measures including a reform of the personal tax system in Belgium, which (if agreed upon and ultimately voted/accepted by parliament) could take effect as of 2025. Please find a high level overview of the proposed measures below.\n\nOne of the key elements of the potential tax reform is a reduction of the personal income tax burden for individual taxpayers (assuming this can be funded). The plan aims to increase the net salaries as of January 1, 2025 by lowering the personal income taxes through the following measures:\n\n1) Increase of the lump-sum tax-free allowance towards the level of the minimal subsistence income for a single person (currently EUR 15.460).\n\n2) Adjustment of the progressive income tax brackets. This would include an expansion of the 25% tax bracket, lowering the tax rate of 40% to 35% and increasing the income threshold for the application of the 50% marginal tax rate.\n\n3) Abolishing the special social security contribution and increasing the job bonus. Finally, the socio-economic note from Mr. De Wever mentions that the tax benefit for child care expenses should gradually be increased from 45% to 100% to make work more rewarding.\n\nIt is anticipated that the reduction of the personal income tax burden can be financed, among other things, by a reform of the existing Belgian tax on securities accounts, and the introduction of a new capital gains tax in case of selling of shares.\n\nThe discussion on a potential tax reform will continue during the coming weeks and months. More news to\ncome.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nSandrine Schaumont\nPartner\n\nPhilip Maertens\nPartner\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&amp;R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Social Security\n\nMiddle East | New end-of-service gratuity system for foreign employees in Bahrain\n\nSummary\nThe Bahraini government has introduced Resolution (109) of 2023, which brings significant changes to the payment of end-of-service “leaving indemnity” for non-Bahraini employees in the private sector. Effective March 1, 2024, employers are required to remit end-of-service entitlement contributions for all relevant employees to the Social Insurance Organisation (SIO) on a monthly basis. This marks a shift from the previous system where employers directly paid leaving indemnity to employees upon termination or resignation.\n\nThe detail\nResolution (109) of 2023 introduces several significant provisions affecting the end-of-service gratuity system for non-Bahraini employees in the private sector:\n\nWhat this means:\nEmployers must adjust their processes to ensure timely submission of salary data and payment of leaving indemnity contributions to the SIO. Failure to comply could result in penalties and sanctions. It also shifts the responsibility of paying leaving indemnity from employers to the SIO, offering greater protection to employees.\n\nEnsure payment of the leaving indemnity for the duration of employment prior to the effective date upon resignation/termination (noting that this remains the responsibility of the employer despite the passing of this Resolution)\n\nHow we can help:\nOur team is equipped to guide employers through the intricacies of Resolution (109) of 2023, facilitating accurate data submission, contribution calculation, and compliance with regulatory mandates.

        "title": "United Kingdom | Immigration | Australia  and | New Zealand Free Trade Agreements now in force",
        "date": "June 6, 2023",
        "content": "02 June 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nThe UK’s post-Brexit trade deals with Australia and New Zealand came into force on 31 May, making it easier for Australian businesses to establish a branch or subsidiary in the UK and for UK businesses to sponsor Australian and New Zealand nationals (and their permanent residents) in specific categories under the temporary Global Business Mobility (GBM) visa route. More generous provisions for Australian and New Zealand graduates and young professionals under the Youth Mobility Scheme have also been negotiated that broaden the talent pool of non-sponsored workers for UK businesses.\n\nThe Detail\n\nUK Expansion Workers\n\nThe ‘UK Expansion Worker’ route is ‘for overseas workers who are undertaking temporary work assignments in the UK, where the worker is a senior manager or specialist employee and is being assigned to the UK to undertake work related to a business’s expansion to the UK’.\n\nSimilar to other categories in the GBM route, employees must have been employed overseas by the business. They must also earn at least £45,800 a year and those earning under £73,900 a year are required to have at least 12 months overseas employment with the business.\n\nAs a result of the Free Trade Agreement with Australia, the Home Office has introduced a new concession for Australian nationals and permanent residents to live and work in the UK under the UK Expansion Worker route. Where Australian businesses are expanding in the UK, Australian nationals and permanent residents are now exempt from the requirement to have worked for their employer outside the UK for 12 months.\n\nFurther Concessions for Australian businesses\n\nUnlike other overseas businesses wishing to establish a branch or subsidiary in the UK, Australian businesses are no longer required to prove that they have traded for at least 3 years overseas before applying for a UK Expansion Worker sponsor licence. The UK has also committed to expand the permitted activities for Australian business visitors, allowing them to enter the UK for up to 90 days in any six-month period to establish a UK presence without the requirement to be sponsored under the UK Expansion Worker route and without seeking any other approval procedure before entering the UK.\n\nService Suppliers\n\nThe ‘Service Supplier’ route is for ‘overseas workers who are undertaking temporary work assignments in the UK, where the worker is either a contractual service supplier employed by an overseas service provider or a self-employed independent professional based overseas, and they need to undertake an assignment in the UK to provide services covered by one of the UK’s international trade agreements that is currently in force or is being provisionally applied.’\n\nCertain eligibility criteria must be met for a Service Supplier visa to be granted, including proof that the sponsor has a contract with an overseas service supplier and that contract:\n\n●      has been registered with the Home Office;\n\n●      is for a service covered by one of the UK’s international trade agreements; and\n\n●      is the contract on which the applicant will work as a Service Supplier.\n\nAs a result of the new Free Trade Agreements, Australian and New Zealand nationals (and permanent residents) are  eligible to apply for visas under the Service Supplier route, giving them the same access to the UK as EU and Swiss nationals. Additionally, Australian nationals are now able to live and work in the UK for a maximum single period of 12 months, rather than the normal six months..\n\nYouth Mobility Scheme\n\nThe UK’s Youth Mobility Scheme ‘provides a cultural exchange programme that allows a person aged between 18 and 30, from participating countries and territories, to experience life in the UK for up to 2 years’, and includes the right to work without being sponsored.\n\nNew Zealand and Australian nationals are currently included in the UK’s Youth Mobility Scheme but more generous provisions for these nationals are due to come into effect, as follows:\n\n●      From 29 June 2023, New Zealand nationals aged between 18 and 35 will be eligible to apply under the Youth Mobility Scheme route, and be able to remain in the UK for up to 3 years (including a 1 year extension).\n\n●      From 31 January 2024, Australian nationals aged between 18 and 35 will be eligible to apply under the Youth Mobility Scheme route, and be able to remain in the UK for up to 3 years (including a 1 year extension.\n\nFor UK businesses, the changes to the Youth Mobility Scheme will widen the talent pool of recent graduates and young professionals from Australia and New Zealand. The changes also have the potential to lead to cost savings for businesses (as sponsorship is not required over a longer period) and a reduction in the administrative burden that sponsorship requires.\n\nRecommended action\n\nBusinesses in Australia and New Zealand seeking to expand to the UK by setting up a branch/subsidiary can explore the UK expansion worker route or even consider the Service Supplier route. While these routes are normally under utilised by employers/sponsors, they require more planning and technical support.\n\nSimilarly, UK businesses who have specific interest in New Zealand and Australia, would also benefit greatly from these new concessions.\n\nHow we can help\n\nVialto Partners is able to provide technical advice and assistance to Australian businesses wanting to apply for a UK Expansion Worker sponsor licence to set up operations in the UK, as well as, assist with UK Expansion Worker visa applications for your employees.\n\nWe are able to assist businesses wishing to apply for a Service Supplier licence, provide visa application advice and assistance for the service suppliers you wish to sponsor, and advise whether your service supplier contracts would be suitable for Home Office approvals.\n\nWe are also able to advise and assist businesses with visa applications for their Australian and New Zealand employees on the Youth Mobility Scheme route, when either initial or extensions are required, or a switch to a sponsored visa route makes business sense.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\n• Andrea Als, UK Director and Solicitor | andrea.als@vialto.com\n• Awale Olad, UK Advisory and Manager | awale.olad@vialto.com\n• Ian Robinson, UK Partner | ian.j.robinson@vialto.com\n• Lucy Vaux, UK Senior Manager and Solicitor | lucinda.vaux@vialto.com\n• Lyudmyla Davies, UK Partner and Solicitor | lyudmyla.davies@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "November 18, 2024",
        "content": "It seems that the week of 18-22 November 2024 should finally bring some further clarity regarding the formation attempts of a so-called “Arizona coalition” to establish a new Federal Government in Belgium. In recent months, political tensions and strategic positioning around new tax measures have complicated the negotiation talks.\n\nLast week, Mr Bart De Wever, leader of the New Flemish Alliance (NV-A), increased the pressure, even hinting at the possibility of new elections. Mr. De Wever, who (following another extension of his mission) is still tasked by the King of Belgium with his role as “formateur”. In this capacity, he recently introduced new proposals, once more amending his Supernote, in which Vooruit leader Conner Rousseau noticed ”important openings”, especially from a tax point of view, which – in the nick of time – seemed convincing\nenough for him to start further negotiations.\n\nPlease note that De Wever’s socio-economic Supernote includes potential reforms touching upon the Belgian labor market, the people’s purchasing power, pensions, as well as suggestions for a more balanced tax system, with wealthier individuals contributing more. However, it needs to be seen, now that Vooruit has decided to be open for further negotiations, if they are prepared to go all the way. Other parties, including NV-A, MR, Les Engagés and CD&V, have already expressed their readiness to proceed, but it can still be a bumpy road. However, further negotiations are expected to be challenging, particularly\nregarding tax reforms and maintaining the coalition’s overall objectives.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nSandrine Schaumont\nPartner\n\nPhilip Maertens\nPartner\n\nNic Boydens\nPartner\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "January 17, 2023",
        "content": "January 16, 2023\n\nImmigration\n\nImpact [High]\n\nSummary\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that on January 30, 2023, it will implement premium processing for Form I-140 new (initial) petitions under the EB-1C and EB-2 NIW classifications. USCIS will also continue to offer premium processing to all previously filed Form I-140 petitions under an E13 multinational executive and manager classification (EB-1C) or E21 classification as a member of professions with advanced degrees or exceptional ability seeking a national interest waiver (EB-2 NIW)\n\nIn the coming months, USCIS also anticipates expanding premium processing services for certain F-1 students who have a new or pending Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization (EAD) and Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status.\n\nThe Detail\n\nBeginning January 30, 2023, USCIS will accept Form I-907 requests for:\n\nAll pending E13 multinational executive and manager petitions (EB-1C) and E21 NIW petitions (EB-2 NIW); and\n\nAll initial E13 multinational executive and manager petitions (EB-1C) and E21 NIW petitions (EB-2 NIW).\n\nPetitioners with pending or new I-140 petitions may submit a premium processing upgrade to USCIS provided the petition meets the requirements above. In order to submit an upgrade, the petitioner must file Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service along with the applicable filing fee to the applicable service center.\n\nIn March, USCIS will expand premium processing to certain F-1 students seeking Optional Practical Training (OPT) and F-1 students seeking STEM OPT extensions who have a pending EAD.

USCIS’ announcement includes notice on future expansions of premium processing for F-1 students and certain students and exchange visitors who have pending Form I-539 applications or who are seeking to file them. Petitioners wishing to upgrade pending and new (initial) I-140 petitions must ensure that any upgrades filed on or after January 30, 2023 are filed with Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service.\n\nWith this announcement, F-1 students will have an avenue to avoid USCIS backlogs and expedite their EAD work authorizations and their Form I-539 applications so that they do not experience a gap in employment.\n\nAs USCIS will make announcements when they are ready to expand additional premium processing, Vialto Partners will continue to provide additional information on the implementation of premium processing for these additional groups as it becomes available.\n\nContact us\n\nPlease reach out to Manish Daftari (manish.daftari@vialto.com) to discuss further.\n\nwww.vialtopartners.com",

        "content": "13 June 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nImpact: High\n\nSummary\n\nThe MIRB has released its Operational Guidelines and FAQ in relation to the Special Voluntary Disclosure Programme 2.0 (“SVDP2.0”), which offers the opportunity for taxpayers to come forward and voluntarily submit (previously unsubmitted) tax returns or disclose prior years’ under-reported income with no penalty imposed. The SVDP2.0 will run from 6 June 2023 until 31 May 2024.\n\nThe Detail\n\nFollowing the announcement of a 0% penalty tax amnesty programme during the Malaysia Budget 2023, the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board (MIRB) has released Operational Guidelines GPHDN 2/2023 on 2 June 2023 which sets out the eligibility criteria and implementation procedures, along with a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document to supplement the Operational Guidelines.\n\nFeatures of SVDP2.0\n\n\n\ni.e., those who have never reported income to the MIRB but have started a business or have income/ disposed asset)\n\n\n\nYs/A\n\n\n\nreturn form for any other Y/A,\n\nor\n\n2) those who have previously declared income to MIRB but still have unreported additional income\n\n\n\n\n\nY/A 2021 and preceding\n\nYs/A\n\n\n\n\n\nVia the link on the SVDP2.0 website or via https://mytax.hasil.gov.my\n\n\n\nIncorrect return, either due to omission or understatement of income, or provided any incorrect information relating chargeability of tax – section 113(2) ITA1967.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, under the Tax Audit Framework, the MIRB may impose penalty at the following rates:\n\n1st offence – 15%\n\n2nd offence – 30%\n\n3rd and subsequent offences(s) – 45%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActions for employers/ taxpayers to consider\n\nWhile the SVDP2.0 is not open to the employer file category (i.e., non-compliance relating to employer’s obligations do not come under this programme), the employer is responsible in ensuring that the correct amount of employment income has been provided to their employees to be declared in their Malaysian personal tax returns. Hence, this opportunity to come forward and make good of the gaps arising from non-compliance is timely, given the full waiver of penalty imposed for late tax return submission/ under-reporting of income.\n\nIn summary, non-compliance gaps may arise due to the following circumstances:\n\nThus, employers with globally mobile employees should take this opportunity to immediately review their assignment structures/employment models and perform a “health check” into their payroll and income reporting processes. This will help to evaluate if there have been any reporting gaps in the past which would require immediate rectification and disclosure to the IRBM to take advantage of the full penalty waiver offered under the Programme.\n\nHow we can help\n\nVialto Partners Malaysia can assist employers to review their assignment structure and policies, together with the effectiveness and accuracy of their payroll system in capturing compensation data for tax reporting. Thereafter, we can assist the impacted employees/ individuals with the preparation and submission of the tax return or additional income reporting form (whichever applicable) to the MIRB.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact,\nor alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Poland | Employment Tax | Employer obligations towards posted workers – implementation of the Directive on transparent and predictable working conditions",
        "date": "June 16, 2023",
        "content": "13 June 2023\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nSummary\n\nOn April 26, 2023, the amendment to the Labor Code and other acts entered into force, which was dictated by the need to implement the provisions of two directives of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) into the Polish legal order, i.e. Directive No. 2019/1152 of June 20, 2019 on transparent and predictable working conditions in the European Union and Directive 2019/1158 of 20 June 2019 on work-life balance for parents and carers and repealing Council Directive 2010/18/EU. The introduction of changes in the EU was caused, among others, by the fact that the existing regulations did not correspond to the current situation on the labor market, as they did not guarantee sufficient protection of employees, including those covered by new and non-standard forms of employment.\n\nThe amendment to the Labor Code extends the information obligations of employers towards employees, including those posted to other countries. Below we present the most important changes in this area.\n\nThe most important proposals for changes\n\nThe amendment introduced many changes in the scope of employer’s information obligations towards employees, including new information obligations for employees posted outside Poland.\n\nAdditional information obligations towards employees posted outside Poland\n\nPursuant to the new regulations, in relation to employees posted to work in another Member State of the European Union or a third country, a catalog of information has been introduced that the employer provides to the employee before his departure to work abroad for a period exceeding 4 consecutive weeks. Pursuant to the new regulations, in addition to the standard mandatory information, the employer is obliged to inform the posted employee about:\n\nAccording to the regulations, documents containing all the required information must be provided to the employee before departure.\n\nThe employer informs the employee about his duties in paper or electronic form. The employer posting an employee from the territory of Poland should keep evidence of the transfer of this information.\n\nAn employer who fails to comply with the information obligation by violating this obligation is liable to a fine for an offense in the amount of PLN 1,000 to PLN 30,000.\n\nThe amendment also introduced changes to the regulations on posting employees to foreign branches of the company, to other countries in order to perform the contract concluded with a foreign entity and sending temporary workers by temporary employment agencies to other EU countries (posted workers – covered by Directive 96/71/EC).\n\nIt is worth noting that the changes are basically consistent with the changes introduced in the Labor Code, but in addition, the employer should inform the posted worker from Poland about:\n\nThis information may be provided to the employee in electronic form, provided that it is available to such employee with the possibility of printing and storing it, and the employer posting the employee from the territory of Poland should keep proof of its transfer or receipt.\n\nThe amendment also introduces a prohibition of discrimination for an employee who requests such information, and in particular may not constitute reason for termination of employment. What is more, in case of violation of his right to provide information about employment conditions and their change, an employee posted from the territory of Poland has the right to compensation in the amount not lower than the minimum remuneration for work.\n\nIf the employer violates the obligation to inform the employee, he will be fined from PLN 1,000 to PLN 30,000.\n\nHow can we help?\n\nAs Vialto Partners, we will be happy to help you understand the scope and impact of the changes on your organization. We can pass on knowledge about the introduced changes to your teams and employees, prepare relevant information for your organization and employees going abroad, and help in preparing the information required for employees posted from abroad to Poland.\n\nContact:\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMore information about Vialto Partners can be found at this link: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

These appointments are often identified in the immigration process cycle as the last step.\n\nExamples of foreign individuals seeking registration appointments are: South-American nationals seeking to be registered under the terms of the Mercosur Residency Agreement; foreign individuals in general who had an Authorization of Residence application approved by the Ministry of Justice and Public Security; foreign individuals in general who obtained a Temporary Visa (VITEM-type) stamp to their passports.\n\nOver the past few weeks, it has been widely noticed that the Brazilian Federal Police has either decreased the number of appointment slots available for foreign individuals or increased the waiting period to obtain a new appointment by several weeks.\nThe repercussions arising from the fewer appointment slots to both the company and the individual are:\n\n(i) without being able to be registered at the Federal Police, some foreigners may have their payroll admission dates be postponed, refraining them to start working in Brazil.\n\n(ii) registrations of foreigners who have had their immigration processes submitted within Brazilian territory must be completed in a maximum of 30 calendar days counted from the date when the Approval Notice was published in the National Official Gazette. In the eventuality that term is not complied with, and that the appointment takes place beyond the 30-day stipulated term, the foreigner individual risks being fined at approx. USD 20 per day up to a maximum ceiling of approx. USD 2,000.\n\n(iii) registrations of foreigners who have obtained a temporary visa in their passports (VITEM-type visas) must be completed in a maximum of 90 calendar days counted from the date of arrival in Brazil. Failure to be registered within that timeframe will also bring upon the foreign individual the same range of fines indicated above.\n\nWith that said, there is no clear announcement from the authorities why the appointments were reduced.\n\nOur Vialto Partners Immigration team recommends that the appointment slots picked up are effectively used, otherwise rescheduling for a later date may trigger fines for late-appointment show. Ad hoc appointments (out of the regular schedule system) remain a possibility, however will ultimately depend on the authorities discretionary powers to accept them or not, based in the arguments provided for such request.\n\nIn view of the recent announcement, our Vialto Partners Brazil team remains available to take any queries from our clients and remains readily available either to advise or to assist in any urgent case.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFlavia Fernandes\nImmigration, Employment, Social Security and Tax Partner\n\nAndré Sousa\nImmigration Manager\n\nAntonieta Mosquera\nSenior Manager\n\nPatrícia Kater\nSenior Manager\n\nRenata Araújo\nSenior Manager\n\nJocelyn Mares\nLATAM Immigration Advisory Lead\n\nSharan Kundi\nGlobal Immigration Lead\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Belgium | Employment Tax | Update—Tax reform 2025",
        "date": "August 26, 2024",
        "content": "Tax\n\nBelgium | Update—Tax reform 2025\n\nSummary\n\nMr. Bart De Wever, leader of the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and during the summer of 2024 key figure in the formation of Belgium’s new federal government, has put forward his so-called socio-economic “supernote” (a masterplan which has been reworked various times during the summer) to the potential partners. The idea was to form an “Arizona coalition”, notably a government that (if negotiated successfully) would replace the current “Vivaldi coalition” (the latter is reduced to a government of current affairs, following the 2024 federal election).\n\nThe plan of Mr. De Wever outlines significant potential reforms with respect to pensions, labor market and – last but not least – the Belgian tax system. For the proposed tax measures quite some inspiration was sought and found in the tax reform measures that were initiated by the departing minister of Finance Mr Vincent Van Peteghem (CD&V), reflections of a previous tax reform attempt for which ultimately no consensus was reached in the summer of 2023 and which ended into a complete deadlock.\n\nOne of the overarching goals of the new tax reform architecture is to make employment (and working in general) more rewarding and more attractive, for example by reducing taxes, thus widening the income gap between working and not working. As highlighted in our previous newsflash, the proposed measures to lower the personal income taxes include a higher tax-free allowance, reduced tax rates, higher income thresholds (in the tax brackets), and the elimination of the special social security contribution.\n\nRecently, the government formation discussions were heavily revolving around the income tax measures (with the introduction of a capital gains tax being a dealbreaker). During the night of 21 to 22 August 2024 the discussions got completely stuck. The press even reports “un parfum de crise”. On Thursday 22 August a new attempt will be made to resolve the matter. Even if the negotiators ultimately do not reach an agreement, some of these tax reform measures will sooner or later be recycled again and pop-up in some kind of draft tax legislation. Without being exhaustive, please find below a high-level overview of potential individual income tax related measures.\n\nHigh-level overview of potential tax measures\n\nProfessional income and family taxation\n\n● Increased lump-sum tax free allowance\n\nAn increase is proposed of the lump-sum tax-free allowance towards the level of the minimal subsistence income for a single person (currently EUR 15.460).\n\n● Tax brackets and rates\n\nFurthermore, an adjustment of the progressive income tax brackets is proposed. This would include an expansion of the 25% tax bracket, lowering the tax rate of 40% to 35% and increasing the income threshold for the application of the 50% marginal tax rate.\n\n● Special social security contribution and job bonus\n\nThe abolishing the special social security contribution (a contribution which was introduced back in 1994 as an additional funding of the Belgian social security) is proposed.\n\n● Job bonus\n\nOne of the measures in the supernote promotes an increase in the federal job bonus (for people with a low income).\n\n● Abolition of the marital quotient\n\nThe marital quotient allows married or legally cohabiting couples to shift up to 30% of the higher-earning spouse’s income to the lower-earning (or non-earning) spouse, effectively lowering their combined tax burden (saving at the marginal tax rate). Mr. De Wever proposes abolishing this mechanism for non-retired couples starting in 2025. For retired couples a phase- out scenario would be foreseen. Such a change would have significant implications for couples where one partner earns little to no income..\n\n● Abolition of the tax deduction for alimony payments\n\nAnother one of the proposed potential measures that could serve as an attempt to provide more neutrality from a family taxation perspective would be the abolition of the tax deduction that is (under very strict conditions) available for (80% of the) alimony or maintenance payments made in the course of the taxable period.\n\n● Increased tax reduction for childcare expenses\n\nThe initial socio-economic note includes the intention to increase the existing tax reduction for childcare expenses, for example from 45% to 100%, at least for people who are working.\n\n● Reform of stock option and warrants regime\n\nStock options, which give the right to buy shares at a predetermined price, and warrants are currently popular as alternative forms of remuneration. However, De Wever’s plan proposes to introduce a solidarity contribution for the holder of the options and warrants making these instruments of remuneration less attractive. The scope would remain limited to options that relate to shares of the employer. The proposal aims to align the taxation of remuneration through stock options and warrants with that of cash payments.\n\n● Taxation of (a benefit in kind for) fuel cards\n\nTo increase the “greening”, Mr. De Wever wants to promote greener transportation. Cycling would be further encouraged by increasing the maximum mileage allowance for biking, while fuel cards would face higher taxes for non-professional trips.\n\nManagement companies\n\n● Addressing the improper use of Management Companies\n\nAs more and more executives establish management companies to optimize their tax situation in Belgium, Mr. De Wever proposes measures to curb this practice. One key measure would be increasing the minimum managerial remuneration (towards the company director) from EUR 45.000 to EUR 50.000, and subject to further indexation, in order to qualify for the reduced corporate income tax rate of 20%.\n\nAdditionally, but in practice linked to that, the revised movable income tax system would result in the phasing out of the current VVPRbis system, which (under certain conditions) allows management companies to distribute dividends at a reduced movable tax rate.\n\nTaxation of movable (savings and investment) income\n\n● Movable withholding tax\n\nThe initial proposal would lower the 30% dividend and interest tax rate to 25%.\n\n● Capital gains tax\n\nLinked to the abovementioned reduction of the flat rate for dividend and interest income, a keypoint of Mr. De Wever’;s proposal is the introduction of a 10% capital gains tax in case of the sale of financial assets, such as shares and bonds. Belgium is one of the few countries where such realized capital gains currently remain untaxed (if realized within the normal management of the individual’s private estate). To protect small investors, Mr. De Wever’s note suggests the possibility of exempting the first EUR 6.000 in capital gains from effective taxation.\n\n● Broad tax exempt amount for movable income\n\nThe tax exemption which is currently applicable to interest income on regulated savings accounts would be extended to interest income from other accounts, state bonds and even other moveable income such as dividend income within a broad tax exempt basket.\n\n● Tax on securities accounts\n\nAt present, there is a 0,15% tax applicable on securities accounts exceeding EUR 1 million. Mr. De Wever’s plan includes a potential reform or an expansion of this existing tax, although the specifics remain unclear, such as whether there will be an increase in the tax rate (for example to 0,30%) or an extension of the scope of application.\n\n● Tax on stock exchange transactions\n\nMr. De Wever wants to give an incentive to investors to invest in the Belgian economy.\nTherefore, the tax on stock exchange transactions for those who buy or sell shares in small or medium-sized quoted companies.\n\nTaxation of immovable income\n\n● No taxation of actual rental income\n\nFor many years now, private individuals who rent out property for non-professional purposes are taxed progressively (via their tax return) on the deemed rental income of the property, which is indexed and increased with 40%. This taxation method is beneficial, because the actual (often higher) rental income is not taxed. It seems to stay that way for the coming years. Indeed, in the supernote of Mr. De Wever no measures are proposed for changing this traditional way of taxation.\n\n● Capital gains tax for immovable property\n\nAlthough this is still very vague, the existing capital gains tax regime for real estate in Belgium would become subject to changes.\n\nThe negotiations continue…\n\nIn the second half of August 2024, it has become clear that the formation of Belgium’s new federal government had arrived at a critical juncture. When writing this flash, negotiations were still ongoing, with several challenges still unresolved. On August 19, 2024 the King of Belgium extended the assignment of formateur Mr. De Wever by 3 days. Is a solution finally in the making and will the parties find a common ground for governance? More news to come.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nSandrine Schaumont\nPartner\n\nPhilip Maertens\nPartner\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "July 24, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nFrance | Immigration Law: several decrees published\n\nSummary\n\nIn the Official Journal of 16 July 2024, several decrees relating to the law of 26 January 2024, known as the Immigration Law, were published. Most of them point towards a tightening of the rules currently in force. They relate in particular to:\n\n– “The principles of the Republic” that any foreigner must sign to obtain a residence permit;\n– The conditions for issuing a work authorization;\n– The expulsions and house arrests.\n\nThey were published a few hours before the resignation of the Attal government which, until further notice, will remain as head of a caretaker government until a new prime minister is appointed. The publication of these decrees comes almost six months after the promulgation of this controversial law.\n\nThese measures, part of a broader immigration reform, have been met with significant opposition from the left and human rights activists. Despite partial rejections by the Constitutional Council, the law was enacted in January 2023.\n\nThe detail\n\nThe new rules are part of a raft of measures aiming to toughen France’s immigration system.\n\nMain changes\n\n– Foreigners seeking residency in France must adhere to &quot;the principles of the Republic,&quot; including personal freedom, freedom of expression, gender equality, human dignity, the Republic’s motto and symbols, territorial integrity, and secularism. Non-compliance with these principles can result in the refusal or withdrawal of residency permits.\n\n– The deadline for execution of an obligation to leave French territory (OQTF) is now 15 days (compared to 30 days before).\n\n– Another decree strengthens the conditions for refusal or cessation of “material reception conditions” for asylum seekers and removes the mandatory prior administrative appeal in the event of refusal of these material conditions.\n\n– An administrative fine has been introduced to penalize the employment of unauthorized foreign workers. Until now, special contributions (when the employed person did not have a work authorization) and flat-rate contributions (when the person was in an irregular situation) were applied.\n\n– The frequency of daily check-ins for those under house arrest awaiting deportation has been increased.\n\n– Simplification of the rules for foreigners’ disputes, with the elimination of various appeals, and establishing the decentralization of the National Court of Asylum, through several territorial chambers.\n\n– Allowing online applications for visas via the france-visas.gouv.fr website, and for systems for digital collection of people’s personal data to be put in place. At present, applications cannot be made entirely online, as the visa application must be printed off.\n\nWhat this means\n\nPeople applying for a first French residency card (carte de séjour) or for each renewal must sign a contract promising to respect “the principles of the Republic”. The permit may be refused or revoked “in the event of a clear breach of one of these principles.\n\nSources\n\n– The Decree of 8 July 2024 relating to the contract of commitment to respect the principles of the Republic, provided for by article L. 412-7 of the entry and stay code foreigners and the right to asylum, implementing article 46 of the immigration law\n\n– Decree No. 2024-809 of 5 July 2024 modifying the system for refusing or terminating material reception conditions\n\n– Decree No. 2024-814 of 9 July 2024 relating to the administrative fine penalizing the employment of foreign nationals not authorized to work and modifying the conditions for issuing work authorizations\n\n– Decree No. 2024-808 of 5 July 2024 lays down provisions relating to the expulsion procedure and house arrest measures provided for by the code of entry and stay of foreigners and the law asylum\n\n– Decree no. 2024-812 of 8 July 2024 taken for the application of article 64 of law no. 2024-42 of January 26, 2024 to control immigration, improve integration\n\n– Decree No. 2024-810 of 6 July 2024 relating to the processing of personal data relating to foreigners requesting the issuance of a visa called France Visas\n\n– Decree No. 2024-815 (Outgoing link, new window) of July 12, 2024 relating to the transmission of information relating to the protection under asylum\n\n– Decree No. 2024-800 (Outgoing link, new window) of July 8, 2024 taken for the application of article 70 of Law No. 2024-42 of January 26, 2024 to control immigration, improve integration and relating to the organization and procedure applicable before the National Court of Asylum\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively to our French law firm (Vialto Société d’Avocats):\n\nArzhvaël Le Fur\nAvocat à la Cour – Partner\n\nViolaine Jaussaud\nAvocate à la Cour – Senior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "January 22, 2025",
        "content": "Social Security\n\nSummary\n\nOn January 13th, 2025, the Brazilian government published the Ordinance n. 6/2025, which adjusts the calculation basis for Brazilian social security contributions due by the individuals starting in January 2025. While the rates remain unchanged from those in effect since March 2020, the income amounts (i.e., calculation basis) subject to each rate have been increased, resulting in higher social security taxes.\n\nThe detail\n\nThe updated social security tax rate table, which reflects the new national minimum wage, applies to all beneficiaries of the Brazilian social security system (INSS). This includes foreign individuals employed by Brazilian companies, as well as Brazilian individuals working abroad with ties to a Brazilian employer. Employers should implement the necessary adjustments to the local payroll for January 2025.\n\nAs of January 2025, employees will be subject to monthly social security contributions based on the updated social security tax rate table, with progressive rates ranging from 7.5% to 14%, as follows:\n\nThe contributions to the social security system will be applied progressively, based on the taxable amount ranges indicated in the table above. Therefore, the new cap amount per month is BRL 951.63 whenever the taxable amount (contribution salary) is equal to or higher than BRL 8,157.41.\n\nThe rules for the calculation of the social security charges due by the employer on top of the total compensation package paid, credited and/or delivered to the individuals remains unchanged.\n\nHow we can help\n\nDepending on the assignment structure adopted in global mobility programs (e.g.: net-to-gross compensation, or split payroll arrangement between home and host countries), the updated tax table may affect the remuneration package offered to the transferred employee. Furthermore, these new rules are likely to impact current budgets for mobile employee populations, as well as payroll processes. The Vialto Partners Brazil team is available to assist clients in identifying the impacts of these changes and implementing the required adjustments to the compensation package and payroll processing.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFlavia Fernandes\nCountry Leader\n\nMarisa Paleari\nPartner\n\nReinaldo Medina\nDirector\n\nJuliana Andres\nSenior Manager\n\nNatalia SPinto\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nSocial Security\n\nResumo\n\nO governo brasileiro publicou em 13/01/2025 a Portaria MPS/MF n. 6/2025, ajustando as bases de cálculo das contribuições à seguridade social devidas pela pessoa física, a partir de janeiro de 2025. As alíquotas vigentes desde março de 2020 foram mantidas, mas as bases de cálculo da contribuição foram reajustadas, resultando em majoração das contribuições.\n\nDetalhes\n\nA nova tabela é baseada no reajuste do salário mínimo nacional e é aplicável a todos os beneficiários da previdência social brasileira (INSS), incluindo as pessoas físicas estrangeiras vinculadas às empresas brasileiras, na condição de empregado, ou brasileiros que trabalham no exterior com vínculo direto mantido com empregadores neste país. Os empregadores deverão implementar os ajustes necessários na folha de pagamentos de janeiro/2025.\n\nDessa forma, a partir de janeiro/2025, os empregados estarão sujeitos ao pagamento da contribuição mensal baseados na tabela atualizada, com alíquotas progressivas de 7,5% a 14%, conforme segue:\n\nAs contribuições ao INSS serão aplicáveis de forma progressiva, de acordo com cada “Salário de Contribuição” indicado na tabela acima. Portanto, o novo limite/teto de contribuição mensal é de R$ 951,63 sempre que o valor do salário de contribuição for igual, ou superior, a R$ 8.157,41.\n\nAs regras aplicáveis para cálculo da contribuição previdenciária devida pelo empregador, a qual é calculada sobre o total da remuneração paga, creditada e/ou entregue à pessoa física, permanecem inalteradas.\n\nComo podemos ajudar\n\nDependendo da estrutura utilizada nos programas de mobilidade internacional (por exemplo: remuneração líquida garantida (denominada como “net-to-gross”), ou divisão do pagamento da remuneração entre país de origem e de destino), a nova tabela poderá afetar o pacote de remuneração oferecido ao empregado transferido. Além disso, as novas regras, provavelmente, afetarão os orçamentos atuais para a população de empregados em mobilidade, bem como os processos de folha de pagamentos. A equipe da Vialto Partners pode auxiliar os clientes na identificação dos impactos decorrentes dessas mudanças, bem como na implementação dos ajustes necessários no pacote de remuneração e processamento da folha de pagamento.\n\nContatos\n\nPara mais discussões sobre o tema, contate seus consultores da Vialto Partners, ou alternativamente:\n\nFlavia Fernandes\nCountry Leader\n\nMarisa Paleari\nPartner\n\nReinaldo Medina\nDirector\n\nJuliana Andres\nSenior Manager\n\nNatalia SPinto\nSenior Manager\n\nMais informações sobre a Vialto Partners podem ser encontradas aqui: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Malaysia | 1:3 Internship Policy by the Ministry of Human Resources",
        "date": "January 23, 2025",
        "content": "Summary\n\nRecently, the Ministry of Human Resources (KESUMA) introduced the Progressive Policy on Expatriate Contribution to Local Talent Development, referred to as the 1:3 Internship Policy. The Policy, which is implemented through TalentCorp, aims to contribute to National Talent Development by requiring companies in Malaysia to hire up to three (3) students under internship for each expatriate employed. The intention is to strengthen local talent by providing them with hands-on industry exposure and making them workforce-ready while still attracting necessary foreign expertise.\n\nThe pilot implementation of the Policy takes effect from 15 February 2025 and will end on 31 December 2025. Thereafter, the Policy will be officially implemented from 1 January 2026.\n\nThe Policy is applicable to all companies obtaining Employment Pass approvals for expatriates from Expatriate Services Division (ESD) or Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC). During the pilot phase, only Tier 1 and Tier 2 MYXpats-registered companies under the purview of the ESD are required to adhere to the Policy.\n\nThe detail\n\nKey features of the Policy\n\n\n\nCompanies that meet the following criteria are exempt from the Policy:\n\nSteps to Apply:\n\nUpon obtaining an Employment Pass approval, companies will receive an email notification from TalentCorp for registration in the MyNext online portal and once the company account is activated, the internship postings can be created for recruitment of interns based on the set ratio.\n\nStudents are required to register with MyNext to browse the latest internship opportunities available and apply for internships which are aligned to their academic requirements.\n\nHow does this new Policy affect you?\n\nAlthough it has been assured by TalentCorp that the Policy is designed to complement existing systems and will not interfere with current expatriate approval processes, companies are encouraged to evaluate their current workforce population and the potential number of internship placements which may apply based on the guidance provided above.\n\nIn addition, it will be essential for companies to assess the internship programmes which can be offered and costs associated with arranging internship placements within organisations in line with this Policy. Whilst companies will not face penalties for non-compliance as the Policy is deployed to encourage active industry participation, companies that meet the Policy requirement will be given more weight and greater consideration for subsequent expatriate approvals. Additionally, companies can claim a double tax deduction via the MyNext online portal for the associated internship expenses.\n\nGiven that the Policy was only recently announced, we will continue to monitor the latest developments and keep you informed as soon as we receive more information from the relevant authorities.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nSasha Reddy       \nPartner\n\nHana Rabi              \nSenior Manager\n\nKimberly Chong  \nManager\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "date": "April 2, 2024",
        "content": "Following our launch as an independent entity after being acquired by Clayton Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), Vialto Partners is pleased to present our inaugural UK Gender Pay Gap Report for 2023.\n\nEmbracing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) as fundamental tenets of our organization, we align these principles with our core values and global operations. This year marks a significant milestone as we report our UK Gender Pay Gap for the first time, fully complying with the reporting requirements and including Partners who are integral members of our team. The data presented encompasses our Client Services and Functional employees in the UK.\n\n\n\nOur median hourly rate does not show a pay gap for women, however our mean hourly rate and both averages for bonus pay show a gender pay gap. This gap is largely driven by pay differences at the highest senior job levels, and in particular due to a higher number of male Partners with global or regional leadership roles in this reporting period.\n\nThe Gender Pay Gap is different from equal pay, and we believe that these pay gaps do not represent pay inequity between men and women. We are fully committed to ensuring that men and women are paid the same for work of equal value.\n\nWe take pride in the gender diversity within our UK team, boasting a composition of 56% women to 44% men. This diversity extends to the highest levels of our leadership, where we achieve a near balance with 47% of our senior partners being women and 53% men.\n\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) are foundational principles at Vialto Partners and we will continue to focus on ensuring we can attract, retain, and progress diverse talent, not only in relation to gender, but also other types of diversity.\n\nStrategic Initiatives: Led by Sarah Mason, our UK Territory Leader, we are proactively addressing the gender pay gap. Initiatives aimed at ensuring equitable distribution of rewards, and enhancing diversity at all organizational levels, are in motion. Our focus extends beyond gender to embrace all dimensions of diversity, aiming for an inclusive culture where everyone can thrive.\n\nCommitment to DEIB: Our DEIB strategy and Inclusion Communities are central to fostering a workplace where diversity is not only recognized but celebrated. Through thoughtful people policies and practices, we’re paving the way for a maximally inclusive environment, driving change within the industry.\n\nLooking Ahead: Vialto Partners welcomes this report as a foundation for continuous improvement. Our commitment to transparency and diversity is unwavering, and we’re excited about the journey ahead. We invite our stakeholders to engage with us as we strive towards an equitable and inclusive future. This report is a stepping stone towards narrowing the gender pay gap. Through concerted efforts and a steadfast commitment to our DEIB values, we’re confident in our path forward.\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above please reach out to:\nSarah Mason\nUK Territory Leader\n\nOlivia Clarke\nEMEA HR Business Partner Leader\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit: www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "December 20, 2023\n\nUnited States | Immigration | Stateside visa renewal pilot program begins January 29\n\nImpact [Medium]\n\nSummary \nBeginning January 29, 2024, the Department of State will accept applications for domestic visa renewal for H-1B nonimmigrant visa applications for applicants who meet certain criteria.  The pilot program was created to reduce worldwide visa wait times and shift some workload to the US. The program will run until April 1, 2024.  The Department of State had previously allowed for domestic visa renewal, but discontinued this program in 2004 as a security precaution following the attacks of 9/11.\n\nThe detail  \nThe Department of State (“DOS”) has created a pilot program that will accept applications for domestic visa renewal for qualified H-1B nonimmigrant visa applications. The program will run from January 29, 2024 to April 1, 2024 and will only accept H-1B applicants who reside in the United States and had H-1B visas issued previously in Canada or India.  The DOS will only accept 2,000 applications from H-1B applicants who received H-1B visas in India and 2,000 applications from H-1B applicants who received H-1B visas in Canada (for a total of 4,000 applications weekly). Applications will be accepted on the following dates: January 29, February 5, February 12, February 19, and February 26.\n\nIn addition to the above, the pilot program will only accept applications from individuals meeting the following criteria:\n\nUnder this program the average processing time for the domestic visa renewal application is expected to be six to eight weeks from the time the passport and other required documents are received by the DOS, and all applications will be processed no later than May 1, 2024.  No requests for expedited processing will be accepted.  However, the DOS will return a passport before processing is completed if the applicant has unanticipated travel plans.\n\nThe DOS is not currently accepting applications for the dependents of H-1B applicants (those holding an H-4 visa) or any other visa type.  The DOS anticipates expansion to other visa categories based on the success of the pilot program.\n\nWhat this means  \nThis program will allow certain H-1B holders who are currently facing long wait times for visa renewals in India and Canada to apply for their visa renewals in the United States. This program will also test how the DOS can help alleviate the workload from overseas offices.  This is a welcome change for employers and H-1B visa applicants who often faced difficulty in securing an appointment at a US Consulate and extended processing times.\n\nContact us \nPlease reach out to:\n\nManish Daftari\n\nto discuss further.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nFinland | 2024 income requirements for Finnish Residence Permit Applications have been confirmed but further increases are still being proposed\n\n2024 income requirements\nEach new year brings some changes to the eligibility criteria for Finnish residence permit applications, as the income limits for specialist residence permit applications and EU blue card applications are adjusted annually.\n\nThese income limits are strict and e.g. per diems or benefits-in-kind are not taken into account in the evaluation. The limits for 2024 have been confirmed:\n\nIn addition, the general minimum income requirement, which e.g. in the absence of an applicable collective bargaining agreement, is applied to the residence permit for an employed person (TTOL category) has been confirmed to be 1 333 € per month in 2024. This is the same amount as the amount, which is required in 2024 in order to meet the conditions regarding previous employment under the Unemployment Security Act.\n\nAn additional increase proposed to the TTOL minimum income limit\nThe Finnish Government has issued a proposal aiming to increase the current monthly minimum income limit from 1 331 € per month to 1 600 € per month. This increase is part of the Government’s political agenda, which the parties in question agreed on in the Government program last summer.\n\nThe government proposal on setting an income limit for obtaining a residence permit as an employed person in Finland is being circulated for comments until January 31, 2024. Changes are planned to take effect later this year. According to the proposal, an income limit of EUR 1,600 per month would be set to ensure the people coming to work and live in Finland have reasonable pay. The expectation is that the income limit will be an issue primarily for part-time employees.\n\nThe current income limit of EUR 1,331 per month still stands until the proposed changes are processed, and possibly accepted by the Finnish Parliament.\n\nWhat this means\nThe revised income requirements must, in addition to other eligibility criteria, be taken into account both when applying for initial residence permits as well as when applying for extensions under these categories. Employers need to pay special attention to roles for which the compensation level is close to the income limit. This may involve doing an inventory of current residence permits and the current salary levels of the employees in question in order to ensure that possible challenges are identified ahead of time.\n\nIndividuals, who are no longer eligible to apply for a certain category will need to consider which alternative category may be available, e.g. an individual, who no longer meets the specialist income limit, may be able to pursue a TTOL residence permit.\n\nContact us\nVialto will continue to monitor developments and the potential impact for companies and employees.

        "date": "January 16, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nBrazil | Updated social security tax table for 2024\n\nSummary\nThe Brazilian government published on January 12nd, 2024 the Ordinance n. 2/2024, adjusting the calculation basis of the Brazilian social security contributions as of January/2024. Rates have remained the same already in force since March/2020, but the amount of income subject to each rate has been adjusted upwards, resulting in higher social security taxes.\n\nThe Detail\nThe updated social security tax rate table is considering the new national minimum wage and is applicable to all beneficiaries of the Brazilian social security system (INSS), including foreign employees working for Brazilian companies or Brazilian individuals working abroad with ties to the Brazilian employer. The employers should implement the required adjustments in the local payroll for January 2024.\n\nThus, as of January/2024, employees will be subject to the payment of monthly social security contributions based on the updated social security tax rate table, with progressive rates from 7.5% up to 14%, as follows:\n\nThe contributions to the social security system will be applicable in a progressive manner, in accordance with each range of remuneration indicated in the table above. Therefore, the new cap amount per month is BRL 908.85 whenever the taxable amount (contribution salary) is equal to or higher than BRL 7,786.02.\n\nHow we can help\nDepending on the current assignment structure adopted on the global mobility programs (e.g.: net-to-gross compensation, or split payroll arrangement between home and host country), the updated tax table may impact the remuneration package offered to the transferred employee. Furthermore, these new rules, likely, will impact current budgets for mobile employee populations as well as the payroll processes.The Vialto Partners team can assist clients with identifying the impacts resulting from these changes as well as implementing the required adjustments in the compensation package and payroll processing.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFlavia Fernandes\nCountry Leader\n\nMarisa Paleari\nPartner\n\nReinaldo Medina\nDirector\n\nJuliana Andres\nSenior Manager\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nEmployment Tax\n\nBrasil | Tabela previdenciária atualizada para 2024\n\nResumo\nO governo brasileiro publicou em 12/01/2024 a Portaria MPS/MF n. 2/2024, ajustando as bases de cálculo das contribuições à seguridade social, a partir de janeiro de 2024. As alíquotas vigentes desde março de 2020 foram mantidas, mas as bases de contribuição foram reajustadas, resultando em majoração das contribuições.\n\nDetalhes\nA nova tabela leva em consideração o reajuste do salário mínimo nacional e é aplicável a todos os beneficiários da previdência social brasileira (INSS), incluindo empregados estrangeiros que trabalham para empresas brasileiras ou brasileiros que trabalham no exterior com vínculo de emprego mantido no Brasil. Os empregadores deverão implementar os ajustes necessários na folha de pagamentos de janeiro/2024.\n\nDessa forma, a partir de janeiro/2024, os empregados estarão sujeitos ao pagamento da contribuição mensal baseados na tabela atualizada, com alíquotas progressivas de 7,5% a 14%, conforme segue:\n\nAs contribuições ao INSS serão aplicáveis de forma progressiva, de acordo com cada faixa de remuneração indicada na tabela acima. Portanto, o novo limite/teto de contribuição mensal é de R$ 908,85 sempre que o valor do salário de contribuição for igual, ou superior, a R$ 7.786,02.\n\nComo podemos ajudar\nDependendo da estrutura utilizada nos programas de mobilidade internacional (por exemplo: remuneração líquida garantida, ou divisão do pagamento da remuneração entre país de origem e destino),a nova tabela poderá afetar o pacote de remuneração oferecido ao empregado transferido. Além disso, as novas regras, provavelmente, afetarão os orçamentos atuais para a população de empregados em mobilidade, bem como os processos de folha de pagamentos.

A lead time of at least two (2) weeks prior to arrival in Malaysia is required in order to obtain the KLIA1 endorsement approval letter. The approval for endorsement at KLIA1 is subject to the discretion of the Malaysian immigration authorities.\n\nThe endorsement process through pass delivery by Pos Malaysia for renewal applications and new applications for foreign nationals who do not opt for KLIA1 endorsement remains the same for the time being. Similarly, the endorsement process for applications submitted through the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) remains the same.\n\nIt is important to highlight that the KLIA1 endorsement facility is only available for foreign nationals who enter Malaysia through KLIA1 and not through any other international airports in Malaysia, including KLIA2.\n\nWhat this means\n\nCompanies will benefit from the expansion of the KLIA1 endorsement process as it now covers the main types of work passes in Malaysia. Foreign nationals who are required to begin work in Malaysia as soon as possible can complete their pass endorsement at KLIA1 upon arrival, instead of waiting for the endorsement to be completed through pass delivery, which may take an additional one (1) week after arrival in Malaysia.\n\nForeign nationals who will proceed with the KLIA1 endorsement process will need to ensure that they obtain the approval letter for endorsement at KLIA1 prior to travelling to Malaysia and sufficient time must be factored in in order to obtain the aforementioned approval letter from the Immigration authorities.\n\nHow we can help\n\nOur team is happy to assist you in understanding the pass endorsement options and processes in greater detail. In the meantime, our team is closely monitoring the implementation of the expanded scope of the KLIA1 endorsement and we will provide you with the relevant updates from time to time.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "February 5, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nUAE | ILOE registration requirement for new and renewal of Employment Residence Permits in Mainland\n\nSummary\nEarlier last year, the UAE Government announced a new requirement for employees in the private and government sectors to register with an unemployment insurance scheme, called the Involuntary Loss of Employment (ILOE). The initial deadline for this registration was 30 June 2023, which was later on extended until 1 October 2023 as per Ministerial Resolution No. 340 of 2023 Amending the Deadline for Imposing Fines Related to the Unemployment Insurance System Contained in Ministerial Resolution No. 604 of 2022 on Unemployment Insurance System. Confirmation of ILOE subscription is now required in order to support the issuance of a Labour card for a new Employment Residence Permit (ERP).\n\nThe Detail\nILOE insurance subscription is mandatory for all private and public sector employees and the deadline to register was extended to 1 October 2023. Failure to register for ILOE within the deadline incurred a fine of AED 400.\n\nThe ILOE scheme introduces flexible duration options for individuals, allowing them to choose between one or two years. Payment will vary depending on the chosen duration.\n\nFrom January 2024, as part of an effort to streamline the implementation of the ILOE insurance scheme, confirmation of ILOE subscription is required prior to the issuance of the Labour Card in a new Employment Residence Permit application for Mainland employees. Furthermore, individuals who have previously held a UAE residence permit must provide a copy of their ILOE insurance certificate in support of their new Labour Card. The fines imposed for late registration are as follows:\n\nTo complete the ILOE registration for applicants who have never held a UAE Residence permit, a new ERP application must be submitted. Upon ERP approval, the applicant’s profile will be generated, and ILOE registration can be completed online after making the relevant payment. Subsequently, the Labour Card will be issued within 24 hours of ILOE registration. Alternatively, an individual can also visit Al Ansari exchange to complete their ILOE registration.\n\nWhat this means\nThe authorities have linked the registration of the ILOE Scheme to the MOHRE systems in order to facilitate the issuance of a Labour Card for work authorisation purposes, and therefore making it mandatory for employees to have an active ILOE policy for processing of Labour Card applications (new and renewal). Failure to evidence an active ILOE policy will delay the processing of Labour Card applications.\n\nHow we can help\nWe understand that for many private sector companies this will require careful workforce planning.

        "date": "December 1, 2023",
        "content": "30 November 2023\n\nImpact Medium\n\nUAE | Update to the Involuntary Loss of Employment (ILOE) scheme\n\nSummary\n\nEarlier this year, the UAE government announced a new requirement for employees in the private and government sectors to register with an unemployment insurance scheme, called the Involuntary Loss of Employment (ILOE). The initial deadline to register was 30 June, which was subsequently extended to 1 October 2023. Failure to register resulted in fines for employees. The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE) has now made available to employers, company specific reports confirming which employees are yet to subscribe to the Involuntary Loss of Employment (ILOE) insurance scheme, along with the corresponding fines.\n\nWe have also had clarification with respect to the validity of a current ILOE policy, in situations where an employee either changes his or her Immigration status in the UAE, or where there is a change in employment.\n\nThe Detail\n\nILOE unsubscribed employee report and fines\n\nThe UAE authorities have released reports to Mainland companies listing employees who have not subscribed to the ILOE along with the individual fines applicable; these reports are available on the company’s respective MOHRE and ILOE portal accounts.\n\nAlthough employers are able to view details of the unsubscribed employee fines, employers are not obligated by the authorities to pay the ILOE fines on behalf of their employees as this remains an employee responsibility. However, the ability of employers to review the list of unsubscribed employees would help to alert employees and ensure subscription with ILOE to avoid non-compliance and recurring fines. Employers in the UAE, do however, have the discretion to pay these fines through the MOHRE portal on behalf of their employees, if they so choose.\n\nIf an employee fails to pay the incurred MOHRE fine within the next three months, the MOHRE is expected to deduct the fine amount directly from the Wages Protection System (WPS) at the time of salary or end of service payment, whichever is applicable.\n\nTo ensure compliance and avoid potential penalties, the following steps must be taken:\n\n1. Employee Subscription: Unsubscribed employees should register for ILOE without any further delay. They can log on to https://www.iloe.ae/ and explore the available subscription channels to complete the process.\n\n2. Fine Payment: Unsubscribed employees are required to pay the MOHRE fine of AED 400 within the next three months to avoid deductions through WPS. The payment can be made through the MOHRE app or website using the following steps:\n\na) Log into https://www.mohre.gov.ae/\nb) Under the ‘Services’ tab, select ‘ILOE Quick Pay’\nc) Enter the necessary details such as Emirates ID Card/Labour Card/UID #/MOHRE Person Number (where applicable)\nd) Follow the steps to complete the payment of the AED 400 fine\n\nChange in residence status and employer\n\nThe authorities have provided clarification with respect to the validity of the policy under the ILOE scheme, in the following situations where an employee has changed employer or there has been a change in immigration category:\n\n● New Labour card: If an employee’s Labour Card is cancelled and subsequently reapplied (irrespective of category e.g. from a Labour card under an ERP to a Labour card under the Golden Visa category), there is no need for an update to the insurance policy as long as the category (A – basic salary less than AED 16K per month or B – basic salary more than AED 16K per month) remains the same. The existing ILOE policy remains the same.\n● Change in employer: If an individual changes their employer, there is no requirement to update the ILOE policy as long as the category remains unchanged. However, if the category changes due to the new employment, the individual must connect with the ILOE – Dubai insurance through email to update their policy accordingly.\n● Job change without updating new employer details in ILOE certificate: If new employer details have not been updated in the ILOE certificate, individuals are still eligible for the ILOE claim. However, this is provided that the individual has fulfilled monthly payments for at least 12 months of their subscription to the ILOE insurance.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThe list of unsubscribed employees is available on the MOHRE company portal for notification purposes only.\n\nThe update from MOHRE regarding the Involuntary Loss of Employment (ILOE) insurance highlights the importance of compliance for both employers and employees. By promptly subscribing to ILOE and paying the fines within the specified timeframe, employees will ensure adherence to the new regulations.\n\nNon-payment of ILOE fines by employees is not expected to have any adverse impact on the MOHRE portal account of the company and at present, it is advisable that companies make their employees aware of non-compliance to the scheme due to the financial penalties involved and the corresponding WPS deduction that would be made by the MOHRE.\n\nIt is also essential for employees to be aware of the updates in respect the validity of a current ILOE policy, in situations where an employee either changes his or her immigration status in the UAE, or where there is a change in employment. Adhering to the guidelines set by the MOHRE is crucial to ensure the smooth processing of claims in case of involuntary job loss. It is recommended that individuals who experience any changes in their employment status or have questions regarding their ILOE policy contact ILOE – Dubai insurance through email for further assistance and clarification. Understanding these updates will help individuals navigate any changes in their immigration status while maintaining the necessary coverage and protection offered by the ILOE insurance.\n\nHow we can help\n\n● We can assist with reviewing and validating the ILOE employee subscription status reports uploaded on the MOHRE company portal, and the ILOE portal;\n● Provide advice in relation to where a change in employer or job might trigger an action by your employees;\n● Provide advice and assistance in relation to your expatriate population, and your immigration compliance in accordance with the UAE’s rules and regulations.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAnir Chatterji\nEMEA Immigration Partner\nanir.chatterji@vialto.com\n\nRekha Simpson\nDirector, Middle East Immigration\nrekha.simpson@vialto.com\n\nUmme Salma\nSenior Manager, Middle East Immigration\numme.salma@vialto.com\n\nAnanth Prasad\nManager, Middle East Immigration\nananth.prasad@vialto.com\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\nContact us on the following address – me-immigration@vialto.com",

This is a request that can be approved or rejected depending on whether certain conditions are met. If the approval is granted, the contract attestation procedures start, the new employer settles the fees online and the residency change approval information is then automatically exported to the Ministry of Interior for final implementation of the actual residency-type change.\n\nThe requirements include the following:\n\n– The employer should have an active Establishment card;\n– The employer should not have any suspensions;\n– There are no ongoing applications of the same type under the same worker.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThis new service is part of the Ministry of Labour vision to implement multiple services on its e-platform, and is designed to help the private sector in Qatar by streamlining the hiring procedure for residents under a family sponsorship status.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe can assist employers with this new process, from the initial assessment right through to securing work authorisation for employees.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nEU | Recast single permit directive formally adopted\n\nSummary\n\nDuring an EU Council meeting this month, EU member states formally adopted the revised Single Permit Directive, which promises to streamline application processes for workers from outside the EU. The new version of the Directive aims to secure shorter decision timelines, provisions for facilitated employer changes, and considerations in case of unemployment. From its publication this week, member states have two years to implement the new rules into their national law.\n\nThe Detail\n\nThe European Council announced the adoption of a long-awaited revised version of the 2011 Single Permit Directive (Directive 2011/98/EU). The Single Permit directive outlines the procedural framework for the issuance of employment related permits by member states to non-EU nationals.\n\nThe recast of the Directive is expected to have a twofold effect. On the one hand, individuals and employers applying for residence and work authorisation in member states would be able to benefit from more simplified and efficient processes and on the other hand, the newly adopted Directive’s goal is to also address the shortage of skilled and talent in the EU while tackling the shortcomings of the existing EU migration policies.\n\nIn order to achieve this, the following key changes to the existing Directive have been adopted:\n\nThe revision of the Single Permit Directive will come into force in the upcoming days and member states will then have two years to transpose the revisions into their national laws.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether, upon its implementation, the new rules will lead to an increase in the number of single permits issued by member states. While the recast Directive grants additional rights to employees, the permit will still generally need to be applied for by employers who will act as sponsor. In this respect it remains to be seen whether the changes will have an effect on the dynamic between employers and their non-EU employees.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nRaj Mann\nDirector\n\nHugo Vijge\nDirector\n\nMarijan Vrhovac\nSenior Associate\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "date": "December 19, 2023",
        "content": "19 December 2023\n\nFinland | Tax | Changes to Finnish taxation in 2024\n\nThis year draws to a close and it’s time to review what the upcoming changes to Finnish taxation brings us in 2024.\n\nThe legislative tax changes increase incentives for wage earners across income levels and include positive news, especially for individuals taxed under the tax regime for foreign employees. The changes are, amongst other things, aiming to enhance Finland’s competitiveness globally and elevate its attractiveness amongst international experts. Meanwhile, buyers of a first home are impacted negatively, as the cost will rise.\n\nThe main changes for 2024 include:\n\nForeign expert status made available for up to 84 months\nThe maximum duration for the 32% flat rate tax for foreign key employees is extended from 48 months to 84 months. At the same time, a new 30-day deadline is introduced for extension applications.\n\nSlightly reduced taxation of earned income under progressive tax rates\nThe taxation of earned income taxed under progressive tax rates is overall reduced, primarily driven by a decrease in social security contributions. Among the tax-like payments, unemployment insurance contributions are reduced, alongside lower health insurance contributions. Additionally, the earned income deduction is increased, and the lower limit for solidarity tax is raised. Depending on income levels, the effective tax rates for wage earners will decrease by 0.5-1.2 percentage points from 2023.\n\nExtension of the temporary increase in household deductions\nThe temporary increase in household deductions for household, care, and nursing work is extended into 2024, now encompassing physiotherapy and occupational therapy services provided at home.\n\nMaximum deduction for commuting costs reduced\nThe maximum deduction for commuting expenses between home and place of work drops from 8,400 euros to 7,000 euros while the non-deductible self contribution portion rises from 750 euros to 900 euros. This could be interpreted as tightening the taxation for employees, who travel extensively due to the location of their home or workplace.\n\nTransfer tax rates reduced but first-time homebuyer exemption removed\nTransfer tax for real estate is reduced from 4% to 3%. For apartments, the tax rate decreases from 2% to 1.5%, and for non-listed securities, from 1.6% to 1.5%. At the same time, the transfer tax exemption for first-time homebuyers is removed from the beginning of 2024. These changes take effect at the turn of the year in 2024, but the tax rates apply retrospectively from the date of the government’s proposal on October 12, 2023, and for subsequent transfers.\n\nInheritance tax payment period extended\nThe inheritance tax payment period is extended to 10 years (interest implications to be taken into account)\n\nMaximum tax free allowances related to business travels confirmed\nThe tax-free domestic daily allowance in 2024 stands at 51 euros (compared to 48 euros in 2023), with a part-day allowance of 24 euros (22 euros in 2023). The tax-free reimbursement rate for kilometers driven is 57 cents per kilometer in 2024 (53 cents per kilometer in 2023).\n\nChanges to equity savings account\nThe maximum deposit amount for an equity savings account increases from 50,000 euros to 100,000 euros. This enhancement in the equity savings account encourages long-term investing more effectively, enabling private investors to maximize the benefits of compound interest.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nRisto Löf\nPartner\nristo.lof@vialto.com\n\nLena Nymark-Akerele\nSenior Manager\nlena.nymark-akerele@vialto.com",

        "date": "May 31, 2023",
        "content": "May 2023\n\nSummary\n\nThe Sejm adopted regulations regarding the Slim Vat 3 package, which introduce changes to the Personal Income Tax Act and the Inheritance and Gift Tax Act. The Senate is currently working on the bill. The new regulations are to come into force, as a rule, from July 1, 2023.\n\nThe introduction of changes in the field of personal income tax and inheritance and donation tax is aimed at eliminating problems arising from the already introduced act, the so-called deregulation and is also intended to support the development of the capital market in Poland. The new regulations increase the limits of the amount free from inheritance and gift tax. The Personal Income Tax Act takes into account the demands of investors and provides for favorable changes for people who do not conduct business activity.\n\nThe most important proposals for changes\n\nAmounts exempt from inheritance and donation tax will increase almost 3.5 times for persons from the 1st and 2nd tax group (family). In relation to persons from the 1st tax group, the tax-free amount per person will increase from PLN 10,434 to PLN 36,120, and for persons from the 2nd tax group, this amount will increase from PLN 7,878 to PLN 27,090. The tax-free amount for persons belonging to the third tax group (people from outside the family) will increase slightly – from PLN 5,308 to PLN 5,733.\n\nThe amendment will enable spouses renting an apartment to pay the tax office 12.5% of the lump sum on income only after exceeding the amount of PLN 200,000. PLN – regardless of whether they will settle separately or decide to tax the income in full by one of them. The current limit was 100,000. zloty.\n\nCurrently, income and losses from the sale of shares and investment funds are treated as capital gains and are taxed at the rate of 19%. PIT. So far, the act required them to be settled separately, which meant that losses from one fund (e.g. equity fund) with income generated under another fund (e.g. debt securities) could not be offset. The amendment to the regulations will make it possible, for example, to offset profits from shares with losses from investment funds (including foreign funds). As a result of the compensation, it will be possible to reduce the PIT payable, moreover, the unused loss in a given year can be settled over the next 5 years. The above changes are to apply from 1 January 2024.\n\nUnder the current legal status, spouses with one child and reaching a total annual income of up to PLN 112,000 may deduct PLN 1,112.04 per year when settling PIT. The above also applies to spouses with a disabled child. The planned amendment will enable spouses with one disabled child to deduct the relief regardless of their income in the year.\n\nSo far, grandparents raising a disabled grandchild, as well as a grandson taking care of disabled grandparents, could not take advantage of the rehabilitation relief. The amendment to the regulations will also enable the above-mentioned persons to benefit from the relief.\n\nHow can we help?\n\nWe are happy to help you understand the scope and impact of the upcoming rules on your tax matters regarding tax returns and donations and their impact on employers.\n\nContact:\n\nWe encourage you to contact our experts if you have any questions:\n\nMore information about Vialto Partners can be found at this link: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Austria | Health insurance coverage as a prerequisite in connection with the residence title in the case of postings to Austria",
        "date": "January 12, 2023",
        "content": "Summary\n\nThird-country nationals require comprehensive health insurance protection in Austria that covers “all risks” in order to be granted an Austrian residence permit, therefore for a minimum stay of 6 months. If there is compulsory insurance due to local employment in Austria, this is sufficient in any case. Co- insurance or voluntary insurance in the statutory health insurance is also sufficient (a waiting period of 6 months may be required for voluntary insurance). More complicated are international postings/hiring outs of third-country nationals to Austria. Various constellations are possible from an immigration and social security perspective. In the following we provide more details on the possible scenarios as well as considerations to be made.\n\nIn detail\n\nRegarding cross-border postings or hiring outs of third-country nationals to Austria, the country of origin (the posting country) is particularly crucial. In the case of postings from an EU/EEA state or Switzerland, different legal requirements must be observed than in the case of postings from a third country. In this article, we refer to all countries outside the EU/EEA area or Switzerland as third countries.\n\n1) Postings from the EU/EEA or Switzerland\n\nIn relation to all EU and EEA member states as well as Switzerland, Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 on the coordination of social security systems (basic regulation) and Regulation (EC) No 987/2009 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, primarily apply.\n\nIn the case of postings from the EU/EEA area or Switzerland, a so-called A1 certificate must be applied for from the competent social security institution, which confirms the applicable social security regulation while working abroad. However, the A1 certificate (“A1”) does not constitute an insurance coverage or an entitlement to benefits in kind (e.g. medical treatment).\n\nIn order to be able to receive medical treatment from the Austrian health insurance, a so-called S1 certificate needs to be applied for in the competent state. The S1 certifies a right to medical care in the home country in the event that the country of residence is not identical to the country in which the social security obligation exists. A registration of the S1 is required in the country of residence in order to receive an e-card (Austria) or comparable document.\n\nIn relation to the UK, the trade and cooperation agreement (‘TCA’) has been applicable since 1 January 2021. In some cases, the former Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 can continue to apply if the specific individual case is covered by the withdrawal agreement. The provisions of the trade and cooperation agreement are largely (especially with regard to multi-state activities) identical to the Regulation (EC) No 883/2004.\n\nIn the case of secondments of third-country nationals, the regulations both from the perspective of the law on employment of foreigners and those relating to residence law must be taken into account. If a third-country national from the EU/EEA area or Switzerland is posted or hired out to Austria for more than 6 months, he or she needs – in addition to other requirements – a residence permit according to residence law.\n\nSince on the basis of the S1 certificate and after the ÖGK has issued an e-card, full medical treatment can be obtained from Austrian health insurance – comparable to people who are mandatorily insured in Austria – the legal requirement of ‘health insurance coverage covering all risks’ for a residence permit is given. In our experience, the immigration authority issues the residence permit if the ÖGK confirms the scope of medical services (based on the S1 certificate).\n\nImportant: The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) does not provide full health insurance coverage (since it only covers medically necessary treatment) and is therefore not sufficient for residence law purposes.\n\n2) Postings from a third country where there is a bilateral social security agreement in place\n\nTemporary postings or hiring outs of third-country nationals from a third country, that is outside the EU, EEA or Switzerland, to Austria are often part of an internal transfer based on a so-called ICT permit (combined residence and employment permit), which is why we refer to this case in our article in detail. However, there is also the possibility of being posted to Austria from a third country on the basis of a posting permit or a work permit.\n\nAccording to the Employment of Foreigners Act (AuslBG), foreigners are permitted to work as an ICT (“Intra-corporate transferee”) if, among other things, the social security regulations are observed. This means that workers posted or hired out to Austria from a third country are generally subject to social security contributions in Austria, unless there is a bilateral social security agreement between Austria and the country of origin, which provides for the employees to remain covered by the social security system of the country of origin in the event of a posting or hiring out.\n\nIn this case, a so-called Certificate of Coverage (equivalent to A1) must be applied for from the competent social security institution, which serves as proof of social security coverage in the country of origin (posting country).\n\nIf the social security agreement also provides for a transfer of benefits in kind (medical care) in the area of health insurance (e.g. the Serbian-Austrian agreement), then a so-called A4 certificate (as an equivalent to the S1) must be applied for in the competent state, which enables employees to claim medical treatment in Austria. As in the case of S1 certificates, the ÖGK would issue a confirmation of health insurance coverage and an e-card after successful registration of the A4 certificate. Please note: The content of the individual provisions of the respective social security agreements may vary, and the implementation in the respective countries may also depend on national requirements.\n\nIf the social security agreement does not provide for a transfer of health insurance benefits (as is the case, for example, in the USA), a certificate of coverage must still be submitted to the Public Employment Service (AMS) during the procedure for issuing an ICT permit, because this proves that the third-country national is not subject to Austrian social insurance contributions during the posting/hiring out in Austria. According to residence law , the immigration authorities must also be presented with health insurance coverage for the ICT employee covering all risks, including the obligation to provide benefits in Austria.\n\nThe requirement for health insurance coverage can be met by voluntary self-insurance with the ÖGK (if there is no 6-month waiting period or this has already expired) or by co-insurance with a relative who is subject to Austrian social security. If there is a social security agreement in place, which also provides for a transfer of healthcare benefits (e.g. medical care is provided in Austria at the expense of the competent country in which the social security obligation exists), voluntary self-insurance in the Austrian statutory health insurance system is not possible. Experience has shown that in most cases there is a 6-month waiting period for the successful conclusion of self-insurance if there are insufficient insurance periods.\n\nFurthermore , the requirement can be met by private health insurance or by a (compulsory) insurance abroad, provided that the insurance is liable to pay benefits in Austria and there is protection in the federal territory corresponding to the statutory compulsory insurance in Austria. However, due to a ruling by the highest court, private health insurance companies must have a scope of services that “essentially” corresponds to the statutory compulsory insurance. It must therefore not contain any risk exclusions such as previous illnesses, pregnancy treatments, dental treatments, or treatments due to accidents under the influence of drugs or alcohol, etc. An extension of private health insurance coverage is possible by means of an additional declaration from the private insurance company.\n\n3) Postings from a third country without a bilateral social security agreement\n\nIf there is no social security agreement between Austria and the third country in place (e.g. China), it is necessary to assess according to national Austrian legislation (§ 3 ASVG) whether compulsory insurance is required as a result of the (temporary) employment in Austria or whether an exception is applicable.\n\nShould an exception apply, according to which Austrian compulsory insurance would have to be denied during the temporary assignment to Austria, this may conflict with the residence law provisions, which provide for comprehensive health insurance protection in Austria. Since the national provisions under social security law and exceptional circumstances cannot always be clearly interpreted for the respective case, we always recommend a case-by-case analysis and – if necessary – a clarification with the Austrian health institution.\n\nIn the event of a company posting (“Betriebsentsendung”) the assessment of a compulsory health insurance coverage needs to be preliminary done by the AMS which also decides upon application about a posting permit, pre-work permit or work permit.\n\nHow we can help\n\nContact us\n\nIf you have any questions about residence and social security regulations in relation to the employment or\nposting of third-country nationals, please contact our experts:\n\nMore information about Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\n\n\nGerman version\n\nZusammenfassung\n\nDrittstaatsangehörige benötigen für die Erteilung eines österreichischen Aufenthaltstitels, somit bei einem Mindestaufenthalt von 6 Monaten, einen umfassenden und “alle Risiken” abdeckenden Krankenversicherungsschutz in Österreich. Besteht eine Pflichtversicherung aufgrund einer lokalen Anstellung in Österreich, ist dies jedenfalls ausreichend. Ebenso ist eine Mitversicherung oder freiwillige Versicherung in der gesetzlichen Krankenversicherung ausreichend (unter Umständen ist im Falle einer freiwilligen Krankenversicherung eine Wartefrist von 6 Monaten zu beachten). Komplizierter wird es bei internationalen Entsendungen/Überlassungen von Drittstaatsangehörigen nach Österreich. Hier sind aus immigrations- sowie sozialversicherungsrechtlicher Sicht verschiedene Konstellationen möglich. Welche diese sind und was es dabei zu beachten gilt, erläutern wir im nachstehenden Überblick.\n\nIm Detail\n\nIm Zusammenhang mit grenzüberschreitenden Entsendungen oder Überlassungen von Drittstaatsangehörigen nach Österreich ist insbesondere auch das Herkunftsland (der Entsendestaat) ausschlaggebend. Bei Entsendungen aus einem EU/EWR-Staat oder der Schweiz, sind andere Rechtsgrundlagen und Erfordernisse zu beachten als im Falle von Entsendungen aus einem Drittstaat. Als Drittstaaten bezeichnen wir in diesem Beitrag alle Staaten außerhalb des EU/EWR-Raumes oder der Schweiz.\n\n1) Entsendungen aus der EU/EWR/CH\n\nIm Verhältnis zu allen EU- und EWR-Mitgliedstaaten sowie zur Schweiz gilt primär die Verordnung (EG) 883/2004 zur Koordinierung der Systeme der sozialen Sicherheit (Grundverordnung) und die Verordnung (EG) 987/2009 zur Durchführung der Verordnung (EG) 883/2004 (Durchführungsverordnung).\n\nBei Entsendungen aus dem EU/EWR-Raum oder der Schweiz ist ein sogenanntes A1-Zertifikat beim jeweiligen Sozialversicherungsträger zu beantragen, welches eine Bescheinigung über die anwendbaren Sozialversicherungsvorschriften für die Dauer einer ausländischen Tätigkeit darstellt. Das A1-Zertifikat (“A1”) begründet jedoch keine Versicherung bzw. Anspruch auf Sachleistungen (z.B. aus der Krankenversicherung).\n\nUm Sachleistungen aus der österreichischen Krankenversicherung beziehen zu können, muss ein sogenanntes S1 Zertifikat im zuständigen Staat beantragt werden. Dies bescheinigt ein Recht auf medizinische Versorgung im Wohnsitzstaat, für den Fall, dass der Wohnsitzstaat nicht identisch mit dem Staat ist, in dem die Sozialversicherungspflicht besteht. Eine Registrierung des S1 ist im Wohnsitzstaat erforderlich, um eine E-Card (in Österreich) oder ein vergleichbares Dokument zu erhalten.\n\nIm Verhältnis zum Vereinigten Königreich muss seit 1.1.2021 das Handels- und Kooperationsabkommen herangezogen werden. Zum Teil kann weiterhin die Verordnung (EG) 883/2004 zur Anwendung gelangen, wenn der konkrete Einzelfall vom Austrittsabkommen erfasst ist. Die Bestimmungen des Handels- und Kooperationsabkommens sind in weiten Teilen (insbesondere in Bezug auf Entsendungen und Mehrstaatentätigkeiten) identisch mit der Verordnung (EG) 883/2004.\n\nBei Entsendungen von Drittstaatsangehörigen müssen grundsätzlich die Regelungen sowohl aus ausländerbeschäftigungs- als auch aus aufenthaltsrechtlicher Sicht berücksichtigt werden. Sollte ein Drittstaatsangehöriger aus dem EU-/EWR- Raum oder der Schweiz für über 6 Monate nach Österreich entsendet oder überlassen werden, benötigt er oder sie – neben anderen Erfordernissen – aus aufenthaltsrechtlicher Sicht auch einen Aufenthaltstitel.\n\nDa auf Basis des S1 Zertifikats und nach Ausstellung einer e-card durch die ÖGK vollumfängliche Sachleistungen der österreichischen Krankenversicherung – vergleichbar mit in Österreich pflichtversicherten Personen – bezogen werden können, ist das gesetzliche Erfordernis eines “alle Risken abdeckenden Krankenversicherungsschutzes” für einen Aufenthaltstitel gegeben. Für die Ausstellung des Aufenthaltstitels reicht der Einwanderungsbehörde unserer Erfahrung nach die Bestätigung der ÖGK über den Leistungsumfang (auf Basis des S1 Zertifikats) aus.\n\nWichtig: Die europäische Krankenversicherungskarte (EKVK oder en: EHIC) gilt nicht als vollumfänglicher Krankenversicherungsschutz (da sie nur medizinisch notwendige Sachleistungen umfasst) und ist daher für aufenthaltsrechtliche Zwecke nicht ausreichend.\n\n2) Entsendungen aus einem Drittstaat, mit dem ein bilaterales Sozialversicherungsabkommen besteht\n\nTemporäre Entsendungen oder Überlassungen von Drittstaatsangehörigen aus einem Drittstaat, somit außerhalb der EU, EWR oder Schweiz, nach Österreich werden oft im Rahmen eines unternehmensinternen Transfers auf Basis einer sogenannten ICT-Bewilligung (kombinierte Aufenthalts- und Beschäftigungsbewilligung) getätigt, weshalb wir in unserem Beitrag näher darauf eingehen. Daneben gibt es jedoch auch die Möglichkeit, auf Basis einer Entsendebewilligung oder einer Beschäftigungsbewilligung von einem Drittstaat nach Österreich entsandt zu werden.\n\nAusländerbeschäftigungsrechtlich werden gemäß Ausländerbeschäftigungsgesetz (AuslBG) Ausländer zu einer Beschäftigung als ICT (“Intra-corporate transferee”) zugelassen, wenn u.a. die sozialversicherungsrechtlichen Vorschriften eingehalten werden. Dies bedeutet, dass aus einem Drittstaat nach Österreich entsandte oder überlassene Arbeitskräfte in Österreich grundsätzlich sozialversicherungspflichtig sind, außer es besteht ein bilaterales SV-Abkommen zwischen Österreich und dem Herkunftsstaat, welches bei Vorliegen einer Entsendung/Überlassung den Verbleib im SV- System des Herkunftsstaates vorsieht.\n\nIn diesem Fall ist ein sogenanntes Certificate of Coverage (Äquivalent zum A1) beim zuständigen Sozialversicherungsträger zu beantragen, welches als Nachweis gilt, dass man im Herkunftsstaat versichert ist.\n\nSieht das bilaterale SV-Abkommen auch einen Leistungstransfer im Bereich der Krankenversicherung vor (zum Beispiel das serbisch-österreichische Abkommen), dann ist eine sogenannte A4 Bescheinigung (als Äquivalent zum S1) im zuständigen Staat zu beantragen, womit man Anspruch auf alle Sachleistungen in der österreichischen Krankenversicherung hat. Wie im Falle eines S1 Zertifikats, würde die ÖGK nach erfolgreicher Registrierung der A4 Bescheinigung eine Bestätigung über den Krankenversicherungsschutz sowie eine e-card ausstellen. Bitte beachten: Die einzelnen Bestimmungen der jeweiligen bilateralen SV-Abkommen können inhaltlich abweichen, und auch die Umsetzung in den jeweiligen Ländern kann abhängig von nationalen Erfordernissen sein.\n\nSollte das bilaterale SV-Abkommen keinen Leistungstransfer in der Krankenversicherung vorsehen (wie zum Beispiel im Falle der USA), muss dem Arbeitsmarktservice (AMS) während des Verfahrens zur Erteilung einer ICT-Bewilligung dennoch ein Certificate of Coverage vorgelegt werden, weil dies nachweist, dass der Drittstaatsangehörige während der Entsendung/Überlassung in Österreich nicht sozialversicherungspflichtig ist. Aufenthaltsrechtlich ist der Einwanderungsbehörde in diesem Fall für die ICT‐Kraft zusätzlich ein alle Risiken abdeckender Krankenversicherungsschutz einschließlich Leistungspflicht in Österreich vorzulegen.\n\nDas Erfordernis des Krankenversicherungsschutzes kann grundsätzlich durch eine freiwillige\nSelbstversicherung bei der ÖGK (sofern keine 6-monatige Wartefrist besteht oder diese bereits abgelaufen ist) oder durch Mitversicherung bei einem Angehörigen, welcher der österreichischen Sozialversicherung unterliegt, erfüllt werden. Wenn ein SV-Abkommen mit dem betreffenden Herkunftsstaat vorhanden ist, welches auch einen Leistungstransfer in der Krankenversicherung vorsieht, ist eine freiwillige Selbstversicherung in der österreichischen gesetzlichen Krankenversicherung jedoch nicht möglich. Erfahrungsgemäß wird in den meisten Fällen für den positiven Abschluss einer Selbstversicherung eine 6-monatige Wartezeit bestehen, sofern keine ausreichenden Versicherungszeiten vorliegen.\n\nDes Weiteren kann das Erfordernis durch eine private Krankenversicherung oder durch ein (Pflicht-) Versicherungsverhältnis im Ausland erfüllt werden, sofern die Versicherung in Österreich leistungspflichtig ist und ein der gesetzlichen Pflichtversicherung in Österreich entsprechender Schutz im Bundesgebiet besteht. Aufgrund höchstgerichtlicher Judikatur müssen private Krankenversicherungen jedoch einen Leistungsumfang aufweisen, welcher der gesetzlichen Pflichtversicherung „im Wesentlichen“ entspricht. Sie darf daher keine Risikoausschlüsse wie insbesondere Vorerkrankungen, Schwangerschaftsbehandlungen, zahnärztliche Behandlungen, oder Behandlungen aufgrund von Unfällen unter Drogen- oder Alkoholeinfluss etc. enthalten. Eine Erweiterung des privaten Krankenversicherungsschutzes ist mittels einer Zusatzerklärung des Privatversicherungsunternehmens möglich.\n\n3) Entsendungen aus einem Drittstaat ohne bilaterales Sozialversicherungsabkommen\n\nSollte zwischen Österreich und dem Drittstaat kein bilaterales SV-Abkommen bestehen (zum Beispiel China), ist nach nationalen österreichischen Rechtsvorschriften (§ 3 ASVG) zu prüfen, ob durch die (vorübergehende) Beschäftigung in Österreich eine Pflichtversicherung besteht oder ein Ausnahmetatbestand (zum Beispiel “Einstrahlungsprinzip”) anwendbar ist.\n\nSollte ein Ausnahmetatbestand anwendbar sein, wonach aufgrund der vorübergehenden Beschäftigung in Österreich eine österreichische Pflichtversicherung zu verneinen wäre, kann dies im Widerspruch zu den aufenthaltsrechtlichen Bestimmungen stehen, welche einen umfassenden Krankenversicherungsschutz in Österreich vorsehen. Da die sozialversicherungsrechtlichen nationalen Bestimmungen sowie Ausnahmetatbestände nicht immer eindeutig für den jeweiligen Fall auslegbar sind, empfehlen wir stets eine Einzelfallbetrachtung und – gegebenenfalls – eine Abklärung mit der Österreichischen Gesundheitskasse\n\nIm Fall der Betriebsentsendung ist die Frage der Sozialversicherungspflicht im Inland vom AMS, welches auf Antrag über eine Entsendebewilligung, Sicherungsbescheinigung oder Beschäftigungsbewilligung zu entscheiden hat, selbst als Vorfrage zu beurteilen.\n\nWie können wir Sie unterstützen\n\nKontaktieren Sie uns\n\nBei Fragen rund um aufenthalts- sowie sozialversicherungsrechtliche Bestimmung in Bezug auf die Anstellung oder Entsendung von Drittstaatsangehörigen kontaktieren Sie gerne unsere Expertinnen:\n\nWeitere Informationen über Vialto Partners finden Sie hier: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nThis publication has been prepared for general guidance on matters of interest only, and does not constitute professional advice.

        "date": "January 29, 2024",
        "content": "Global Equity | Update—January 2024\n\nCanada | 2024 CPP Enhancement Contribution Changes\n\nAs of 1 January 2024, the second enhanced CPP contributions have been introduced. These contributions are subject to a different income ceiling and must be reported in Box 16A (which is now available on the T4).\n\nThe Second (enhanced) CPP contributions are made by employees who earn more than the first ceiling, but up to the second ceiling at a rate of 4%. Employers will also contribute 4% on the employee’s behalf.\n\nQPP\nThe first and second earning ceiling for QPP are in line with the Federal / other provincial ceilings (with the second ceiling being higher than the first ceiling by 7% in 2024 and by 14% in 2025 and future years). However, the employee and employer QPP contributions for 2024, 2025 and future years will be as follows:\n\nThe current C$3,500 exemption continues to apply to both CPP and QPP.\n\nGermany  | Future Financing Act\nThe “Future Financing Act” came into force from 1 January 2024, introducing a change in employee share ownership among other things.\n\nThe annual tax-free allowance for no-cost or discounted employee shareholdings from an employer to employees has increased from currently €1,440 to €2,000. For example, this is applicable to employees receiving restricted stock units as these are generally granted at no-cost to the employee.\n\nThe other requirements for wage tax exemption remain in place. The tax-free allowance can be obtained if the employee participation scheme:\n\nIreland  | Finance Bill (No. 2)\nFinance (No.2) Bill 2023 came into effect for all share option gains made on or after 1 January 2024 outlining such gains will be subject to payroll withholding. Employers will need to operate Income Tax, Income Tax, Universal Social Charge (USC) and employee social security (PRSI) on stock option gains.\n\nPreviously stock option gains were taxed via the self-assessment system and that position remains unchanged for gains made on or before 31 December 2023.\n\nEmployers will need to prepare quickly and consider:\n\nOther clarifications will be needed from Revenue, in particular for globally mobile populations such as:\n\nOn other share option related updates, Revenue had previously identified that employees may not be fully aware of their tax obligations where they participate in an employee share scheme and this was therefore identified as an area of Revenue focus. Since that time Revenue issued an Employer Notice requesting that all employers operating share-based remuneration schemes circulate the necessary information to assist employees in meeting their obligations. Following this we are seeing a significant increase in Revenue cross-checking employer returns (Form RSS1 and Form ESA) against income tax returns submitted by employees.\n\nAnomalies identified typically result in Revenue issuing compliance intervention letters to employees which not only result in assessments for underpayments of tax but also interest and penalties. More recently we have seen an increasing trend by Revenue in raising an interest assessment for the late payment of tax. Given the continued scrutiny from Revenue in this area, employers may wish to consider a reminder to employees of their obligations in respect of calendar year 2023 and prior years.\n\nItaly  | Government 2024 Budget Bill\nOn 19 December 2023 the Council of Ministers approved the final version of the Legislative Decree on International taxation providing some amendments to the Inbound tax regime, named “impatriati.”\n\nThe percentage of tax-exempt employment income is reduced from current 70% to 50% or to 60% where the major exemption applies only to employees with a child of age below 18 remaining resident in Italy with the parent employee.\n\nAn annual threshold of €600,000 has been introduced. Employment income above this limit will be fully taxed.\n\nThe current qualifying conditions are amended as follows:\n\no 6 tax years, where the foreign employment was not performed in favor of an Italian employer.\no 7 tax years, where the foreign employment was not performed in favor of an Italian employer.\n\nThe following condition has been added:\n\nAs for the current law provision, the tax benefit will apply for 5 years, starting from the tax year in which the taxpayer becomes an Italian tax resident. However, it will no longer be possible to extend the special tax regime for a further 5 years.\n\nTransitory provisions\nThe above-mentioned changes will not apply to the taxpayers who will register with the Italian record of resident population (i.e. anagrafe) by 31 December 2023. These employees will be allowed to benefit from the current and more favorable inbound tax treatment.\nIn addition, those employees who will register with “anagrafe” in 2024 and become owners of an Italian residential property in the timeframe that goes from twelve months prior to their transfer in Italy and 31 December 2023, will benefit from the possibility to extend the inbound tax regime for 3 additional tax years. The extension in these cases will allow for a tax exemption on 50% of employment income capped as above while the property will need to be used as their primary residence.\n\nAmendment of Personal income Tax rates\nCurrent Personal tax rates are set as follows:\n\nOn 30 December 2023 the Council of Ministers introduced the new applicable income tax rates with the Legislative Decree n.216. Only for the 2024 tax period, the progressive IRPEF rates and the income brackets to be applied when determining the gross tax have been consolidated to three brackets as follows:\n\nTaxation of Fringe benefits\nFor benefits offered to employees, tax exemption shall apply up to the threshold of €1,000 per year. The tax-exempt threshold shall increase to €2,000 if granted to employees with dependent children.\n\nNetherlands | Current changes to the 30% Ruling\nNew changes to the 30% ruling came into effect on 1 January 2024.\n\nThe 30% ruling is now a 30 / 20 / 10% ruling (subject to transitional law). For the first 20 months, the tax free percentage will remain 30%. For the second 20 months, this will be maximally 20%. In the last 20 months, the maximum tax free percentage will be 10%. The maximum duration of the 30% ruling remains to be five years.\n\nTransitional law\nIn the amendment, transitional law is included for individuals for whom the 30% ruling is applied in the last wage tax period of 2023 (usually December 2023). For these individuals, the maximum tax-free percentage remains 30% of the Dutch taxable wage during the period the 30% ruling has been granted by the Dutch tax authorities.\n\nSee for more details on the recent legislative changes our extensive update  (including the changes to the partial non-resident taxpayer status that are scheduled to apply as of 1 January 2025).\n\nSalary Cap\nIn addition to the above, effective 1 January 2024 the maximum salary eligible for the 30% ruling is capped at €233,000 per annum (subject to separate transitional rules), i.e. a maximum tax free amount of €69,900 (€233,000 x 30%) can be provided on an annual basis. For the portion of the income exceeding this threshold, no 30% ruling tax free allowance can be provided. This legislative change was already approved in 2022, with transitional law up to 31 December 2025 for individuals for whom the 30% ruling is applied in the last wage tax period of 2022 (usually December 2022).\n\nFuture developments\nDuring 2024, the 30% ruling and the recent changes will be further evaluated. In the 2025 Tax Plan, depending on the outcome of the evaluation, it could be that the changes will be (partially) withdrawn, updated or that further changes will be announced.\n\nContact us\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAmyLynn Floodamy\nPartner\n\nMarc Bosottimarc\nPartner\n\nGemma Ludwig\nDirector\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found on our website: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit: www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "United Kingdom | Immigration  | Migration Advisory Committee recommends 21 occupations be included on the new Immigration Salary List",
        "date": "February 28, 2024",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nUnited Kingdom | Migration Advisory Committee recommends 21 occupations be included on the new Immigration Salary List\n\nSummary\nIn its sweeping reforms to immigration salaries back in the Autumn of 2023, the Home Office commissioned the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to undertake a ‘rapid review’ of the salaries in the current Shortage Occupation List (SOL) with a view to abolishing the list and replacing it with a new Immigration Salary List (ISL). The MAC’s commission provides an assessment of only a part of the overall reforms expected and a more wide-ranging review of the ISL will be carried out in due course.\n\nWhat does it mean to be added to the ISL?\nImmigration salary thresholds in the Points Based System (PBS) tend to be multi-layered, it can range from a general salary threshold, which is currently set at £26,200, a new entrant threshold for younger migrant workers under the age of 26 plus Student and Graduate visa switches (set at the 20% discount the general threshold, £20,960), and various other salaries set at ‘going rates’ or subject to further discounts. These thresholds will change from April 2024 with the introduction of a new general threshold that will be set at £38,700.\n\nSeparate categories in the PBS also come with their own salary thresholds, such as the Global Business Mobility visa.\n\nOnce the SOL is abolished, the new ISL will allow employers to hire sponsored workers more or less in the same way but will only be able to utilise from a much more diminished list of eligible roles. Jobs placed on the ISL will:\n\nNew Entrant threshold\nThe Home Office has also confirmed that ‘for now, the new entrant discount available for those aged 26 and under plus Student and Graduate visa switches will continue. In its current form, this discount provides a 30% discount on the occupation-specific threshold and a 20% discount on the general salary threshold, the higher of which must be paid’. The threshold for new entrants will now probably be around £30,960, however, the Home Office would need to accept the MAC’s advice. The rules will be officially published on 14th March and we will see the full details then.\n\nThe new Immigration Salary List:\nBelow is the table for the proposed new ISL. The MAC has, however, set out some caveats to its report that:\n\nThe following SW occupations have been recommended for the ISL. These occupations were previously recommended for the SOL in MAC’s 2023 review:\n\nThe following occupations have been recommended for the ISL. Under the old salary thresholds, MAC considered in its 2023 review that they were able to use the SW route without inclusion on the SOL but now would benefit from being on ISL given the higher salary thresholds and there are no clear and obvious reasons to exclude them in the interim:\n\nOccupations recommended for the ISL where inclusion is sensible due to increased salary thresholds.\n\nHow we can help\nVialto Partners has been working closely with businesses who are set to be impacted by both the salary threshold increases and the reform to the SOL. In addition to our modelling of the impact of the changes, Vialto Partners has produced a market leading salary dashboard that can scrape the data of all your sponsored workers and provide valuable insights into the average shortfall in salary, looking at jobs/roles affected by the changes and locations. Moreover, we can provide more data where the additional costs will have an impact including the apprenticeship levy, additional employer pension costs, and extrapolate with greater detail the national insurance contributions (NIC) differences between local hires and those on assignment.\n\nGet in touch with your Vialto Partners contact (or using our contact details below) for more information.\n\nContact us \nPlease reach out to the UK-inbound team, below, to discuss further.\n\nLyudmyla Davies\n\nIan Robinson\n\nLucy Vaux\n\nAwale Olad\n\nKelly Terrington\n\nMaggie Liang\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here:  www.vialtopartners.com\n\nFor additional alerts, please visit www.vialtopartners.com/regional-alerts\n\nContact us on the following address – me-immigration@vialto.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nDespite significant progress in clearing the immigration adjudication backlogs, the Department of Home Affairs in South Africa has extended the current concessions until 30 September 2025 due to anticipated delays in finalising certain categories and printing of the visa outcomes.\n\nThe visa status of foreign nationals, whose applications remained pending at 28 March 2025 (waiver / appeal / renewal), are extended until 30 September 2025. Accordingly, foreign nationals holding expired long term visas or visas due to expire prior to 30 September 2025, who had an application pending at 28 March 2025, may continue conducting the activities for which their visas were issued, until 30 September 2025.\n\nTravel: Individuals holding expired visas may travel internationally without being declared undesirable and return to South Africa to continue to await the outcome of their pending applications subject to presentation of prescribed supporting documentation. However, non-visa exempt passport holders are required to apply for a Port of Entry visa prior to returning to South Africa which will require additional processing time and administration.\n\nEligibility: The concession is only applicable to foreign nationals who have been legally admitted into the Republic and subject to prescribed documentation.\n\nThe detail\n\nAppeals: Foreign nationals who have submitted an Appeal against a negative outcome received in respect of a long-term visa application, are granted an extension of their current visa status until 30 September 2025. Accordingly, all foreign nationals who submitted an Appeal on or before 28 March 2025, are legally entitled to continue the activities endorsed on their current visa (even if such visa has subsequently expired) until 30 September 2025. Impacted foreign nationals may travel, subject to presentation of a copy of their Rejection letter and the VFS Appeal receipt. Non-visa exempt passport holders must apply for a Port of Entry visa prior to returning to South Africa which will require additional processing time and administration.\n\nWaivers:  Foreign nationals who have submitted a Waiver application in respect of a long-term visa application, are granted an extension of their current visa status until 30 September 2025 to provide sufficient time for the collection of the Waiver outcome and submission of the required long-term visa application thereafter. Accordingly, all foreign nationals who submitted a Waiver application on or before 28 March 2025, are legally entitled to continue the activities endorsed on their current visa (even if such visa has subsequently expired) until 30 September 2025. Impacted foreign nationals may travel, subject to presentation of a copy of their VFS Waiver receipt. Non-visa exempt passport holders must apply for a Port of Entry visa prior to returning to South Africa which will require additional processing time and administration.\n\nLong-term Visas: Foreign nationals with a pending long-term visa application at 28 March 2025, are granted an extension of their current visa status until 30 September 2025. Accordingly, all foreign nationals with a pending application at 28 March 2025, are legally entitled to continue the activities endorsed on their current visa (even if such visa has subsequently expired) until 30 September 2025.

Non-visa exempt passport holders must apply for a Port of Entry visa prior to returning to South Africa which will require additional processing time and administration.\n\nWhat this means for employers\n\nAll foreign national employees holding expired long-term work visas for which an application remained pending at 28 March 2025 are legally authorised to continue working in the same role as endorsed on the current visa until 30 September 2025 or until the visa outcome is received (whichever occurs first). Accompanying foreign national family members of such employees, awaiting extension of their respective long-term dependent visas (accompanying spouse / accompanying parents / study visa) are further extended to 30 September 2025 or until the visa outcome is received (whichever occurs first).\n\nAll foreign national employees holding expired Section 11(2) Visitors Visas are deemed to be excluded from these concessions at present. Should there be any further updates impacting such foreign nationals, these will be shared separately.\n\nFurthermore, all foreign national employees whose long-term visas have expired, and who wish to abandon their pending visa applications, may leave the country by 30 September 2025 without being declared undesirable.\n\nShould you have any queries, please contact your dedicated Vialto consultant, copying our Team Mailbox: za_immigration_south_africa@vialto.com\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nStephen  Marlin\nTerritory Leader\n\nSupriya Boodhena\nSenior Manager\n\nNatalie McLean\nSenior Manager\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "date": "May 24, 2024",
        "content": "Employment Tax\n\nGermany | Flat-rate taxation for company events—News on wage tax and social security\n\nSummary\n\nThe Federal Tax Court (BFH) ruling of 27.03.2024 (VI R 5/22) opens up new possibilities for employers when taxing company events. Clarifying decision of the Federal Social Court (BSG) of 23.04.2024 (B 12 BA 3/22 R) on the retroactive application of flat-rate taxation must be observed.\n\nThe detail\n\nFlat-rate taxation for company events which are not open to all employees\n\nIf an employee takes part in a company event organized by the employer, this can lead to a taxable non-cash benefit in accordance with Section 19 para. 1 sentence 1 no. 1a EStG, which must be considered accordingly in the payroll. It must be an “event at company level with a social character”. Taxation may be waived if the event is open to all employees and the tax-free allowance of EUR 110 is not exceeded. This is possible for up to two company events per year.\n\nIn accordance with § 40 para. 2 sentence 1 no. 2 EStG, employers have the option, if the tax-free amount is exceeded, to tax the benefits at a flat rate of 25%. A further advantage is the resulting exemption from social security contributions in accordance with Section 1 (2) of the Social Security Remuneration Ordinance.\n\nIn the aforementioned ruling, it was now decided that a company event within the meaning of the lump-sum provision of Section 40 para. 2 sentence 1 no. 2 EStG can also exist if it is not open to all members of a company or part of a company. The requirement that the event is open to all employees has only been necessary for the application of the tax-free allowance since the change in the law from 2015.\n\nThe applicability of this ruling beyond the individual case decided would mean a significant simplification of the wage tax procedure for employers. It now remains to be seen how the tax authorities will react to the BFH ruling.\n\nRetroactive application of flat-rate taxation and consequences for social security\n\nIn the decision of the Federal Social Court (BSG) of 23.04.2024 (B 12 BA 3/22 R), it was also clarified that the exemption from social security contributions in the event of using the flat rate taxation in accordance with Section 40 para. 2 sentence 1 no. 2 EStG requires that the flat-rate taxation takes place “with the payslip for the respective payroll period”. If the lump-sum taxation is made at a later date (in particular after the wage tax certificate has been issued), this no longer leads to exemption from social security contributions and there is a risk of late payment penalties.\n\nDeutschland |  Lohnsteuerpauschalierung bei Betriebsveranstaltungen – Neuigkeiten in der Lohnsteuer und Sozialversicherung\n\nZusammenfassung\n\nMit dem BFH Urteil vom 27.03.2024 (VI R 5/22) eröffnen sich neue Möglichkeiten für Arbeitgeber bei der Besteuerung von Betriebsveranstaltungen. Die klarstellende Entscheidung des Bundessozialgerichts vom 23.04.2024 (B 12 BA 3/22 R) zur rückwirkenden Anwendung der Pauschalversteuerung ist zu beachten.\n\nDetails\n\nLohnsteuerpauschalierung bei Betriebsveranstaltungen, die nicht allen Arbeitnehmern offen stehen\n\nNimmt ein Arbeitnehmer an einer Betriebsveranstaltung des Arbeitgebers teil, kann dies gem. § 19 Abs. 1 Satz 1 Nr. 1a EStG zu einem steuerpflichtigen geldwerten Vorteil führen, der entsprechend in der Gehaltsabrechnung zu berücksichtigen ist. Es muss sich um eine “Veranstaltung auf betrieblicher Ebene mit gesellschaftlichem Charakter” handeln. Eine Besteuerung kann unterbleiben, sofern die Veranstaltung allen Arbeitnehmern offensteht und der Freibetrag in Höhe von 110 EUR nicht überschritten ist. Dies gilt für bis zu zwei Betriebsveranstaltungen jährlich.\n\nGemäß § 40 Abs. 2 Satz 1 Nr. 2 EStG haben Arbeitgeber die Möglichkeit, bei Überschreiten des Freibetrags die Zuwendungen mit 25% pauschal zu versteuern. Weiterer Vorteil ist zudem die hieraus resultierende Beitragsfreiheit in der Sozialversicherung gem. § 1 Abs. 2 SV-Entgeltverordnung.\n\nIm o.g. Urteil wurde nun entschieden, dass eine Betriebsveranstaltung im Sinne der Pauschalierungsvorschrift des § 40 Abs. 2 Satz 1 Nr. 2 EStG auch dann vorliegen kann, wenn sie nicht allen Angehörigen eines Betriebs oder eines Betriebsteils offensteht. Lediglich für die Anwendung des Freibetrags sei das Erfordernis, dass die Veranstaltung allen Arbeitnehmern offensteht, seit der Gesetzesänderung ab 2015 erforderlich.\n\nEine Anwendbarkeit dieses Urteils über den entschiedenen Einzelfall hinaus würde eine deutliche Vereinfachung im Lohnsteuerverfahren für Arbeitgeber bedeuten. Es bleibt nun abzuwarten, wie die Finanzverwaltung auf das BFH-Urteil reagiert.\n\nNachholung der Pauschalversteuerung und Konsequenzen für die Sozialversicherung\n\nIn der Entscheidung des Bundessozialgerichts vom 23.04.2024 (B 12 BA 3/22 R) wurde zudem klargestellt, dass es für die Beitragsfreiheit in der Sozialversicherung bei der Pauschalbesteuerung gem. § 40 Abs. 2 Satz 1 Nr. 2 EStG erforderlich ist, dass die pauschale Besteuerung “mit der Entgeltabrechnung für den jeweiligen Abrechnungszeitraum” erfolgt. Eine spätere Nachholung der Pauschalbesteuerung (insbesondere nach\nAusstellung der Lohnsteuerbescheinigung) führt dann nicht mehr zur Beitragsfreiheit in der Sozialversicherung\nund es drohen Säumniszuschläge.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nMathias Schmitt\nPartner – Employment Tax\nSteuerberater\n\nAnna Liepelt\nSenior Manager – Employment Tax\nSteuerberaterin | Rentenberaterin\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Denmark | Social Security | New Oresund social security agreement",
        "date": "May 14, 2024",
        "content": "Global Social Security\n\nDenmark – Sweden | New Oresund social security agreement\n\nSummary\n\nA new social security agreement has been concluded between Denmark and Sweden to make commuting between Denmark and Sweden easier. The agreement replaces an agreement from 2001. The main feature of the agreement is the change of the applicable reference period for calculating work-split. The agreement leaves many practical questions unanswered.\n\nThe detail\n\nNew Oresund social security agreement\n\nWith the inauguration of the Oresund bridge between Denmark and Sweden in 2000 the Danish and Swedish authorities entered into a special framework agreement to ease access to the joint labour market in the region.\n\nThe agreement allows a commuter to work in the country of residence up to (and including 50 %) without triggering social security contributions in that country. To a very large degree, the agreement mirrors the logic in the new EU Framework Agreement for Teleworkers now in place among many EU/EEA countries.\n\nSince the original agreement was concluded, the underlying EU social security coordination rules has been substantially modernized and amended with the latest update taking effect in 2012. Denmark and Sweden have now modernized the Oresund agreement. As the basic agreement text originates from 2001, an update has been highly due in order to align with the underlying EU rules. The main features of the new Oresund agreement on social security are the reference period by which the work-split between Denmark and Sweden is calculated. This is extended from 3 months to 12 months.\n\nThis amendment must be seen in conjunction with the bilateral tax agreement between Denmark and Sweden. The tax agreement has an equivalent scope of applicability, meaning that the employee must work 50 % or more in the country of the employer. It has recently been announced that the bilateral tax agreement is to be amended, including a new 12-month reference period expectantly taking effect by 2025. The two agreements on tax and social security will therefore be aligned in this respect.\n\nSome comments and practical considerations\n\nAs the social security agreement is now concluded with the current EU social security coordination rules as a backdrop, this leaves a number of ambiguities.\n\na) The new rules do not include any transition mechanism. This means that it is currently unclear if and how the new agreement can be applied directly to existing cases or whether the new rules should be individually opted into. Such cases include:\n1. Commuter cases commenced before 1 May 2024.\n2. Oresund A1 certificates that are already in place before 1 May 2024.\n3. Oresund opt-in agreements that have already been concluded before (but A1 expired before 1 May 2024).\n4. 3-month reference periods that do not align with the date 1 May 2024.\n\nIn practice, it is therefore important to keep a close communication with employees for which the above is relevant to ensure that the new rules are only used for cases to which the agreement does in fact apply.\n\nb) The new 12-month reference period mirrors the reference period of the existing EU social security coordination rules, which was introduced in 2010. However, according to recent EU Court case-law the reference period must be equal to the posting period, which has been extended from 12 to 24 months. It is therefore debated whether the current rules mandate a 24-month reference period. Also, it is not clear whether the new rules allow for an agreement-based deviation on this matter. Should a future (EU) guideline provide for a 24-month reference period, or the EU coordination rules be amended in this respect, it is unclear how the current rules align with this.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, it is important to ensure that the rules are correctly applied, especially for the period until 2025 when the tax agreement is amended.\n\nc) The new agreement continues the preexisting rules under which only sporadic and one-off business trips to other EU/EEA countries and Switzerland are allowed. This limitation is to avoid that the business trips trigger special rules on multi-state activities to apply between EU/EEA-countries besides Denmark and Sweden. The scope for the multi-state rules have been substantially narrowed by the EU Court case-law since the Oresund agreement was originally concluded. The multi-state rules now only apply if the employee habitually performs significant work in each EU/EEA-country. This provides for a substantially broader margin for performing business trips without triggering multi-state rules than originally presumed in the Oresund agreement. This broad margin is however not reflected in the wording of the new agreement. It is therefore unclear whether the new agreement supports such a board margin for business trips or not. Also, it is not clear how to operate the Oresund rules in situations for which the posting conditions are not met. This could for example be newly hired employees.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, it is important that an individual A1 is applied for in parallel to the Oresund A1, covering each business trip.\n\nd) Under the old Oresund agreement, business trips were allowed to be performed in other “EU/EEA countries and Switzerland” without triggering the multi-state rules. This phrasing has been continued in the new rules. It is therefore unclear whether business trips to the UK are allowed under the new agreement. As such business trips can be managed under the special posting provision protecting from UK social security coverage, it could be presumed that UK business trips are allowed although such an interpretation is in direct contradiction with the specific wording of the agreement.\n\nFrom a practical perspective it is important that employees that perform UK business trips are monitored with care and that A1 certificates are in place beforehand covering the UK trips.\n\ne) The original Oresund agreement only applied to situations which involved “one employer”. The revised Oresund agreement applies to situations involving “an employer”. This could indicate that the new rules also apply to situations in which the employee has a second employment in the country of residence. However, certain parts of the agreement text do not support such an understanding. As the underlying EU social security rules were amended in 2012 especially to accommodate for this, it will be interesting to see how the new rules will be interpreted in this respect. Also, new rules on transparent working conditions disallows for the employer to ban the employee from taking up a secondary job.\n\nIn practical terms it is important to understand the exact limits of the agreement and ensure that this is communicated to the employees.\n\nf) In order for the employee and employer to opt into the Oresund agreement, a standard consent document designed by the authorities must be concluded. As of now (Monday 13 May) an updated standard consent document is not available.\n\nIn practical terms it is therefore important to ensure that the correct consent document is signed.\n\nOperating the Oresund agreement within the framework of EU social security rules\n\nThe existing EU social security rules provide a substantial flexibility for accommodating cross-border commuter setups.\n\nIn the aftermath of Covid-19 a renewed focus on this flexibility has emerged and new standard cases for operating social security for commuters are consolidating. The Oresund agreement therefore provides one of several solutions for managing social security for commuters.\n\nSome major features are:\n\na) When possible, utilizing a special posting mechanism, which allows for the employee to work above 25 % or 50 % in the country of residence for a limited period of time.\n\nb) Operating an in-depth understanding of how to calculate the work-split, taking into account work time vs workdays, sick days, vacation days, travel days inside and outside the EU/EEA, etc.\n\nAlso, as long-distance commuting has grown increasingly popular, the Oresund agreement has become relevant to such cases and is not confined to the Oresund Region only. For example, long-distance commuting between Stockholm and Aarhus could be governed by the agreement.\n\nHow can we help?\n\nAt a current stage, Vialto Partners is in contact with the Danish and Swedish authorities to settle the above ambiguities and we will provide further advice as these matters resolve.\n\nFurthermore, we are happy to assist with the following:\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nAdam Rewucha\nDirector\n\nGisela Sjödahl\nDirector\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nFrance | Parliamentary Elections—What the results of the Parliamentary elections could mean for immigration\n\nSummary\n\nWith the anti-immigration National Rally (RN) coming third in the parliamentary elections, their ability to shape immigration policy is likely to be more limited than before. The leftist alliance New Popular Front (NFP) won the most seats, with Emmanuel Macron’s Ensemble close behind.\n\nIt is now up to the French President to appoint the Prime Minister to lead a new government. However, given the absence of an outright majority, the current government should remain in place to manage current affairs, until the new National Assembly convenes on July 18th, 2024. What this will mean for immigration policy remains to be seen.\n\nThe detail\n\nThe results\n\nFollowing the second round of voting in France’s parliamentary elections for the National Assembly, Marine Le Pen’s anti-immigration National Rally did not make the gains earlier polls had suggested. With all votes counted, no party has obtained the 289 seats required to govern with an outright majority. At the time of writing, the key results are reported to be as follows:\n\nNew Popular Front: 182 seats\n\nEnsemble: 168 seats\n\nNational Rally: 143 seats\n\nThe Republicans: 46 seats\n\nThis means negotiations between party leaders will determine whether a coalition can secure a majority or, alternatively, a minority government can survive a no-confidence vote.\n\nWhat this means for migration policy\n\nThe results signal a change in direction for the National Assembly. However, the change in direction may not immediately be towards a stricter policy on migration and asylum, as would likely have been the case if National Rally had emerged as the winner.\n\nIn recent months, National Rally was able to pressure Macron into enacting stricter rules on immigration, such as introducing migration quotas, restricting nationality rules and limiting the renewal of certain temporary residence permits. This was part of a compromise deal to pass sweeping changes to France’s immigration legislation, including new categories for medical workers and undocumented workers.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nIt is unlikely that National Rally will be able to exert similar influence following this election result. However, the NFP alliance may be well placed to do so in future. As many parties who are now part of the NFP alliance were opposed to the legislative deal that was passed, it is possible that some restrictive measures could be reversed.\n\nThis depends on the outcome of talks between party leaders and how they plan to govern during the upcoming parliamentary term. Emmanuel Macron’s presidential term ends in 2027.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nSharan Kundi\nPartner\n\nArzhvaël Le Fur\nPartner\n\nViolaine Jaussaud\nSenior Manager\n\nHugo Vijge\nDirector\n\nFrédérique Montalti\nDirector\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.

        "title": "Sweden | Stricter rules on obtaining citizenship",
        "date": "January 22, 2025",
        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nThe Swedish government is proposing to impose stricter requirements on the acquisition of citizenship in Sweden. An extensive and detailed report was published in January 2025, in accordance with the Inquiry’s remit. The new policies are proposed to enter into legal force in Sweden on June 1st, 2026.\n\nThe detail\n\nKey policy suggestions from the report\n\nIncrease in required period of residence in Sweden. The Inquiry suggests increasing the required period of residence for acquiring Swedish citizenship from five to eight years. Some exemptions may apply.\n\nStronger emphasis put on good conduct and an honest lifestyle. The Inquiry proposes stricter requirements for an applicant’s lifestyle to acquire Swedish citizenship, emphasizing good conduct and an honest lifestyle. The waiting period for applicants with criminal offenses should be extended, and non-contact orders should prevent the obtaining of citizenship until a certain time has passed. Offenses committed outside Sweden should also be considered when evaluating conduct. The requirement for a clean criminal record should be more stringent, disqualifying applicants reasonably suspected or convicted of serious offenses (with a penalty of two years or more).\n\nIntroduction of civic and language tests. The Inquiry suggests expanding the citizenship test on Swedish society and language. Additionally, they propose that a section of the test should include knowledge on human rights, specifically on children’s rights as outlined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nIntroduction of a maintenance requirement. The Inquiry proposes a new requirement for applicants to demonstrate self-sufficiency. This means that they must demonstrate proof of a steady income from salary or business activities that meets a specified minimum after tax deductions. This will follow the line of requirements for other grounds of residence permits in Sweden. The applicant must also not have received income support under the Social Services Act for a period totalling more than six months in the three years prior to application. Exceptions to the maintenance requirement will apply, but only in a very limited manner.\n\nWithdrawal of the notification procedure for citizenship. The Inquiry proposes phasing out the notification process for acquiring Swedish citizenship, redirecting children, young adults aged 18–20, and former Swedish citizens to the regular application process instead. The remaining notification procedure would apply only to stateless children and young adults aged 18–20 born in Sweden, Nordic citizens, and children born before April 1, 2015, outside Sweden to an unmarried Swedish father at the time of birth.\n\nIncrease in application fees. Paragraph header. To fund the examination of the new requirements, the Inquiry proposes that the fee for applications under Section 11 of the Citizenship Act be increased from SEK 1 500 to SEK 2 900. Furthermore, the Inquiry proposes the introduction of a fee of SEK 475 for applications concerning children.\n\nPolicy implications\n\nThe policy suggestions in the Inquiry’s report are in line with the political philosophy of the Swedish right-led government, in which immigration legislation is becoming more stringent and protectionist. The Swedish government argues that the proposed policies mark a paradigm shift when compared to today’s requirements for obtaining Swedish citizenship.\n\nThe results of the Inquiry’s report will be reviewed by the government and potential adjustments may take place before the proposed implementation date on June 1st, 2026.\n\nThe full report is available at the Swedish Department of Justice.\n\nContact us\n\nFor a deeper discussion on the above, please reach out to your Vialto Partners point of contact, or alternatively:\n\nPatrik Nyström\nSenior Manager – Immigration\n\nIda Eriksson\nSenior Associate – Immigration\n\nWant to know when a Regional Alert is posted?\n\nSimply follow our Vialto Alerts page on LinkedIn and posts will be displayed on your feed.\n      To ensure you don’t miss one, once you’re on our LinkedIn page, click on the bell icon\n      under the banner image to manage your notifications.\n\nFurther information on Vialto Partners can be found here: www.vialtopartners.com\n\nVialto Partners (“Vialto”) refers to wholly owned subsidiaries of CD&R Galaxy\n      UK OpCo Limited as well as the other members of the Vialto Partners global network.\n      The information contained in this document is for general guidance on matters of interest only.\n      Vialto is not responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use\n      of this information.

        "content": "Immigration\n\nSummary\n\nThe United Arab Emirates Government has implemented a significant change to the eligibility requirements for Golden Visas under the ‘High Skilled Professional’ route for employees already working in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe detail\n\nEffective immediately, employees applying for a Golden Visa under the Highly Skilled Professional route should have completed at least two years of continuous employment with their current United Arab Emirates employer (the sponsor of their Employment Residence Permit) prior to the date of their application.\n\nWhat this means\n\nFor Employees: Previously, an employee’s tenure with their current employer was not a pre-requisite to applying for a Golden Visa. However, UAE Employment Residence Permit (ERP) holders are now required to complete two years of continuous service with their current employer before becoming eligible to apply and they may need to renew their ERP (which is issued for two-years and renewable thereafter) before submitting an application to demonstrate a full two year period.\n\nFor Employers: Employers should inform employees of this updated requirement to avoid premature or ineligible applications. Workforce planning should consider this revised timeline, particularly for employees who have recently joined or who may be transitioning within the organisation.
